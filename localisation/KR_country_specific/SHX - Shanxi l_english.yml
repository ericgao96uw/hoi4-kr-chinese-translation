 SHX_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "国民军\n§g国民军，或者叫西北军，是军阀冯玉祥控制的武装集团，它虽然在意识形态上与国民党相似，但是由于地理阻隔，它们又彼此独立。国民军的独特之处在于严明的纪律、强烈的意识形态动力和优秀的训练水平——所有这些都使它举国闻名。国民军的军纪和动力来源于对冯玉祥的忠诚，而有趣的是，由于冯玉祥本人的基督教信仰（尽管他坚信国民军士兵不必是基督徒），整个国民军中有大量基督教和准社会主义的声音。在反奉战争中，国民军在与直军和奉军的战斗后几近崩溃，冯玉祥不得不将国民军残部撤到了军阀阎锡山统治的山西省。虽然阎冯两人结成了某种务实的联盟，但国民军依然是晋陕两省规模最大的武装部队——冯玉祥无疑会利用这一优势。§!"

He is not merely a puppet of outside powers or Yan however: Liang has a rather large coterie of ultra-nationalistic militiamen under his command, composed of younger gentrymen and other radicalised elites, all under the banner of his so-called \"Sacrifice League\". As they work to radically reshape Shanxi's social and political structure, many wonder if his puppet masters have their regrets in their choice."

 SHX_share_the_wealth_mining_concern_desc: "Over the years and under the fluctuating jurisdiction of the Shanxi Bureau of Public Mines, Yan's government (and often, his personal pocketbook as well) has acquired increasingly large stakes in many ostensibly private mining ventures in Shanxi province. One of these has attracted some renewed attention with recent developments in Shanxi, namely the Share-the-Wealth (Tung-Bao) Mining company, which historically sought to exploit the large coal deposits in the northern and eastern parts of the province. The de facto loss of East Shanxi to the Zhili, severe disruption caused by the Fengtian-Zhili wars, and extensive corruption caused by exorbitant salaries given to Yan's lackeys prevented meaningful modernisation in the 1920s. Now, however, with expanded operations, many hope the reorganised Share the Wealth company will truly allow for the people of Shanxi to benefit from the province's extensive mineral wealth."
 SHX_experimental_school_concern: "乡村教育实验学校"
 SHX_experimental_school_concern_desc: "作为十年计划的早期阶段项目，山西建立了一所“乡村教育实验学校”，该校的校董会由阎锡山、冯玉祥和赵戴文本人负责。这所学校在内部而言相当成功，它从1933年成立之始就吸纳了有着不同家景的学生，并提供了简单而先进的农业课程。这所学校有着相当理想主义的目标：它要打破阶级偏见，现代化农业教育并结合理论学习与实际田野工作，可谓是凌云之志。乡村教育实验学校在省内省外都被大力宣传，以彰显山西统治者的开明进步，有人认为“作为实施村级经济重建的基石，他们将会成为组织群众的先锋并让乡郊变得焕然一新”。将乡村教育实验学校视作“十年计划”中最杰出的成就可以让计划的名声上升到新的高度，但此学校是否真的名副其实（而不仅仅是另一个橱窗宣传），将会在未来几年里揭晓。"
 SHX_taiyuan_arsenal: "太原兵工厂"
 SHX_taiyuan_arsenal_desc: "太原兵工厂于1923年在阎锡山的命令下建成，它既是中国重要的军火生产中心，也是山西得以维持自治的关键资本。这个巨大铸造厂生产包括手枪、步枪、火炮、手雷和弹药在内的各式武器，并有着过千名工人。太原兵工厂也有能力造出西式军备（或者至少造出相似仿品），产于该厂的武器质量在全国内基本上无厂能及。晋系军阀对太原兵工厂的掌控让他们有希望于某日有能力与资源更多的敌人在战场上抗衡。"
 SHX_shanxi_automobile_company_concern: "西北汽车运输公司"
 SHX_shanxi_automobile_company_concern_desc: "The proud product of the Ten Year Plan's State Capitalist agenda, the Northwest Automobile Transportation Company is a government-backed enterprise that receives extensive funding from the provincial government. Sharing a name with and serving as a spiritual successor of an earlier project established by Feng Yuxiang, this modern iteration contrasts with its predecessor in that rather than seek foreign suppliers, it focuses on domestic production. Churning out an impressive catalogue of cars, trucks, and other motor vehicles, the powers that be hope to fill Shanxi's recently renovated roads with new cars driven by middle-class Chinese rather than wealthy foreigners. While the quality is somewhat suspect despite what state propaganda claims, it does appear to be gaining some traction and making sales (albeit primarily in-province rather than for export). Long term, the administration hopes to repeat the successes of similar state projects such as sulfates, iron works, and machine tool factories - not particularly efficacious on their own but helping build a trained industrial workforce for the future. With any luck, one day Shanxi will have a thriving automobile industry of its own."

 shx.0.t: "晋系军阀"
 shx.0.d: "山西，傲然挺立之省，大禹治水之地，其历史悠久而辉煌。自古以来，这片隐于群山之中的土地接受着历朝历代的统治，如今又被置于晋系军阀的管辖之下。虽名为晋系，该军阀却仅控制着山西西部以及陕西的部分地区。它由德高望重、老谋深算的阎锡山统领，后者自辛亥革命时起便一直担任山西督理一职。他雄心勃勃、旨在实现山西现代化的方案，为其本人赢得了“模范督理”的美称。\n\n阎锡山曾是中国北方权利纷争的参与者，通过先后支持袁世凯、段祺瑞二人，他成功在日益险恶的政治环境下稳固了统治。然而，吴佩孚带领的直系于1928年大获胜利，本已垂死的北洋政府得以苟延残喘。张作霖撤回关外，冯玉祥则带着国民军投奔阎锡山。为对抗日益强大的直系势力，两位旧敌被迫握手言和，接受清廷复辟以换取北京承认阎锡山的督理职位。目睹北伐与第四次直奉战争的灾难之后，两大山西的铁腕人物誓要重整旗鼓、报仇雪恨。\n\n近十年过去，事态的发展并不尽人意。尽管阎锡山享有“模范督理”的称号，冯玉祥也抱持理想主义的观点，但在晋系军阀治下，半途而废或彻底失败的方案比比皆是。意在振兴山西的十年计划停滞不前，省内经济几乎是一潭死水。时间来到1936年，贫困、腐败和坐视不管等痼疾还将继续折磨这片土地。然而，纵使问题重重，有一种看法却未曾改变：在这瞬息万变的中国，没人胆敢坐以待毙。"
 shx.0.a: "山西至上！"
 shx.1.t: "国民军的现状"
 shx.1.d: "阎督理并非是山西的唯一强权。冯玉祥大帅于1926年决定同国民党生死与共，随后在次年被打得血流成河、支离破碎，并撤退到了陕西。不久之后阎锡山的失利让他不得不与冯玉祥达成协议，在吴佩孚试图一劳永逸地消灭国民军时，阎锡山公开宣称假如冯玉祥被赶出中国，他就会和冯玉祥“携手出国考察，环游世界。”据说冯玉祥还和阎锡山是拜把子兄弟，这进一步促成了他们的联盟。\n\n自那时起，他们就互利共存，互相依附，这两位传奇人物也都在彼此推动着看似互补的进步愿景。阎锡山得到北京的中央政府承认，确保了山西省的法律地位；而与当地士绅数十年来的亲密关系则维护了该省的稳定。冯玉祥则是一位走南闯北的军人，他和平民之间有着不错的关系，而他的那支热情洋溢、经验丰富的军队也拱卫着该省的山口。\n\n然而，两人也同时在国内外争出风头，而且他们怀着两种截然不同的救国构想。阎锡山坚信中国需要一个强大的、慈父般的人物来带领她摆脱贫困，并渴望建立一个以儒家思想为基础，但并不一定走传统路线的稳定社会。冯玉祥的信仰则更具革命性，他呼吁为了人民的利益要对国家进行激进的变革。不幸的是，随着时日推移，两人的梦想都毫无能够走向实现的迹象。"
 shx.1.a: "同省异梦。"
 shx.2.t: "东亚监事会宣布在八省联合扩张"
 shx.2.d: "在孙传芳和他的亲信庆祝由东亚监事会建设的铁路通车之时，阎锡山与他的内阁还在继续与德国人讨价还价。长期以来，正太铁路垄断了山西与南方的铁路运输，并赚取高额的运费。阎锡山一直不愿意承担铺设新铁路的费用，并要求中央政府对铁路建设进行补助。王骧、北京的代表与北京福公司（背靠华东监事会）在努力达成一致，但华东监事会坚持使用标准轨道而不是阎锡山想用的窄轨。谈判陷入了僵局，阎锡山（在冯大帅的热烈支持下）很快退出了谈判。\n\n又一轮失败的谈判体现了本世纪初以来山西的孤立主义经济。山西曾经是几家银行与商业中心的所在地，这些在当地称之为票号（即汇票银行）。该省的巨额财富已经蒸发，中国的动乱让山西十户九贫。群山的阻隔以及中国的极端派以及太原与中央政府之间的不信任扼杀了这个省的经济增长。然而阎督理仍然对自己的能力充满信心，并确保他可以让山西免受中央政府的不良影响。"
 shx.2.a: "我自己有些想法…"
 shx.3.t: "冯玉祥提出向国民军划拨更多经费"
 shx.3.d: "阎锡山保住了山西的自治权，这令冯玉祥喜出望外，亲自提议要在下一次会面上做东家。至于会面的话题，则是一件二人耳熟能详，但聊起来却谈不上愉快的事：军费开支。一支强大的军队是山西防卫的关键，也是吴佩孚在八年前的制胜法宝。然而，对于山西这样一个贫穷省份而言，供养一支军队就已近极限，更别说两支了。虽然人人都从联盟的角度出发讨论阎冯的实力，但二人实际上均各自保有军队，即山西省军和国民军。\n\n为节省军费开支，自三十年代初起，两支军队的规模都遭受了削减。阎锡山和冯玉祥秉持军队服务百姓的理念，派遣士兵参与公共工程，偶尔也要求他们务农。此举看似无可挑剔，但在粉饰的表面之下，无数士兵早已心怀不满，军队素质在过去六年中也持续恶化。阎冯二人心知肚明，两支军队间的分歧是导致效率低下的元凶，但无论哪一方都不愿在主导权问题上做出让步。话虽如此，由于资金匮乏，外加局势并未生变，双方大概率会将争论暂时体面地搁置，转而处理其他事务。"
 shx.3.a: "我山西百废待兴，力有不逮啊。"
 shx.3.b: "我想知道更多有关我军的事。"
 shx.3001.t: "我军组成"
 shx.3001.d: "有两支军队拱卫着山西，离太原较近的是省军。山西省军最早形成于阎锡山早期对于流寇和其他军阀的抗击中。作为中国为数不多的完全由本省人组成的军队，从纸面上说他足以称得上一支可以保卫家园的积极力量。这支军队配备着由现代化的太原兵工厂生产的武器，军官则从教育良好的士绅中招募并在本地接受训练，在外人眼中是一支强大的军队。但实际上，这支军队无法与真正勇猛的敌人作战，出了山西更是如此。和中国的其他军队一样，玩忽职守、士气低迷对他们来说是家常便饭——毕竟很多人参军只是为了有一份稳定的工作，或者是谋财图权，一旦遇到什么危险，他们就会逃之夭夭。\n\n国民军则是冯玉祥经由多年在华北南征北战、四处闯荡而慢慢建立起来的军队。国民军以勇敢顽强、纪律严明和民粹主义为核心，吸引了许多晋系军阀之外的人，这些人也慢慢在陕西定居下来。冯玉祥和国民军以自己是一支“老百姓”（农民和普通人）的军队而自豪。这支共和主义的、准社会主义的、经验丰富的军队以自己的优秀素质而自豪。虽然在实战中他们是否优于中国其他地区的民兵或是军队还有待商榷。\n\n这两支军队将共同保卫山西免遭外来侵略——不过他们究竟会同心协力还是互相掣肘，尚有待观察。"
 shx.3001.a: "这帮后生值得我们骄傲！"
 shx.4.t: "黑色星期一到来！"
 shx.4.d: "世界另一头传来的噩耗席卷了中国，甚至也波及了我们这样与世隔绝的省份！在黑色星期一的余波蔓延之时，上海证交所宣布关闭，而其他的交易所也纷纷效仿，导致中国的经济一落千丈。尽管山西政府已经努力将自己与中国其他地区的经济孤立，但许多与沿海地区有关联的产业仍然完全陷入崩溃。很不幸，这会影响我们的出口并让本不富裕的省份雪上加霜。许多人担心山西会重返那个黑暗的年代，那个饥荒横行，父母卖掉孩子的年代。\n\n太原已经出现了反租界和排外主义抗议，参与的许多是那些本就生活在挣扎中的学生，虽然有些在之前就找不到工作，但如今也找到了可以背黑锅的对象。山西的省银行在努力维护民众和商界的信心。尽管黑色星期一的损失在山西造成的损失不如在世界上其他地区那么严重，但这对于山西人民来说仍是一场彻头彻尾的灾难。"
 shx.4.a: "我们现在可不想要这个！"
 shx.5.t: "拍往北京的电报"
 shx.5.d: "随着时间的推移，八省联合的崩溃所带来的危机让中央政府彻底对各地失去了控制，一个新的暴力时代在中国到来了。不过，对他阎锡山来说，这种政治暴力可是一点都不陌生——自从1911年的那场革命以来，他已经经历了几十年的军阀混战，对这种事情见得多了。阎锡山很清楚如果要生存下来，那就必须要采取务实的态度来做出决策，那些先前的盟友？那些小恩小惠？谁他娘在意。圆滑多变才能在乱世生存下来。\n\n而随着吴佩孚对中国的控制力日渐衰落，他麾下的中央军不得不被迫分散开，同时关注南北中国的每一丝动向，因此他手上的兵力已经相当的捉襟见肘了，换句话说，北京那边需要一个盟友，一个朋友。但盟友需要承诺才能结成，而在这个互相背刺的时代，没人能给出免费的承诺。转过头来看看山西，山西也需要一个盟友，一个拥有雄厚财力且行事谨慎的盟友，一个不会对山西内部事务指手画脚的盟友。也许山西的孤立主义是时候画上句号了，也许……是时候去和那“中央政府”建立起一份伙伴关系了。\n\n当阎锡山草拟完电报之后，模范督理那难以捉摸的头脑中的齿轮也开始转动了起来。战争和混乱会带来机会，在这个充满变数的时代，今天的盟友也许明天就会刀兵相见。如果他能打好这一手牌，也许他就能迈出国家统一的第一步，当然，是遵循他的统治。"
 shx.5.a: "我们只能等待。"
 shx.6.t: "冯玉祥前往陕西"
 shx.6.d: "当冯玉祥知道阎锡山，他现在的合作伙伴向北京拍出电报请求援助之时，暴怒一词已经无法描述他的心情了。尽管阎锡山在事后虚伪的向冯玉祥保证这也就是个为民族解放大业收集必要资源的伎俩罢了，但在国民军的眼里，与腐败的直隶和他们的满族皇帝傀儡所进行的任何合作或者援助都是对当前双方合作的背叛。和阎锡山一样，冯玉祥和察觉到了孙传芳之死所带来的机遇。只不过，冯玉祥想要的并不是取而代之，当下一个土皇帝，而是打算彻底砸碎整个旧秩序。阎锡山拍出援助电报之事并未与冯玉祥共议，而且他事后虚情假意的借口也未能平息冯玉祥的屈辱感，于是冯玉祥便召集上了自己的人马，离开太原前往陕西去了。\n\n若无意外的话，冯玉祥的目的地应该是陕西延安，毕竟大部分国民军都驻扎于此。在此之前的十年里，国民军一直在延安苦心经营，鼓动，劝说，煽动他们所热爱的老百姓，让他们去反对过去几十年来剥削压迫中国的帝国主义与资本主义，以及促成这种剥削的汉奸。许多外界观察家曾认为国民军在整个30年代所受到的打击已经让他们一蹶不振，但现在的事实说明，国民军已经开始了他们的觉醒。\n\n尽管冯玉祥引发了一阵狂热的浪潮，但他还是宣称国民军仍然忠诚于一个“山西人民的政府”，这样的说辞很明显是意味着他们想要保留作为政府一分子的地位，至少现在如此。但明眼人都看得出来，大清又一次在崩溃的边缘摇摇欲坠，而他冯玉祥已经开始了自己的谋划。但他想要做什么？政变？革命？还是叛乱？反正对阎锡山来说肯定不是什么好事情。"
 shx.6.a: "他老子敢？"
 shx.7.t: "井岳秀之死"
 shx.7.d: "随着山西省内已事实上地一分为二，那些关于背叛和谎言的消息也开始涌现出来。然而这其中最令人震惊的应该还得数井岳秀将军在家中被枪击身亡。井岳秀将军是陕西人，也是辛亥革命时代革命军的指挥官。早年他是杨虎城的盟友，回来也选择了与国民军结盟，而在西安对抗刘振华的叛乱里也让他赢得了高层的名声。但对于社会主义者，工会还有农会的疑心，和北伐后对革命的幻灭又让他与国民军之间产生了距离。而在那之后，他可能投靠了阎锡山的流言一直在山西省流传着。\n\n当地警察的初步调查现已完成，不论从什么角度来看，这都不过是一个意外罢了，手枪的不慎走火了结井岳秀的生命。然而问题在于，井岳秀是榆林地区的主要控制者之一，他在陕北的强大影响力意味着他对阎锡山和冯玉祥都产生了重大的威胁。他的葬礼将于今日举行，他的许多前部下也将在这样的紧张时刻前往参加葬礼。山西的人民普遍认为，这次事件属于……"
 shx.7.a: "令人发指的暴行！"
 shx.7.b: "悲惨的意外。"
 shx.8.t: "督理班底"
 shx.8.d: "尽管冯玉祥和阎锡山的名声广为流传（而且今后还大有可为），但这两位自命不凡的巨头仍不过只是一部巨大机器的中心零件。这两位军阀不是简单地通过敲诈勒索他们的人民来建立统治，他们半合法的权威仍然来自养活并守护自己的人民。多年来，他们已经构建出了一套包含着文官、知识分子、军人、显贵以及一些见不得光的事物的复杂关系网。\n\n而辅佐山西统治者的则是一群影响深远的顾问（有官方的也有非官方的）。这些人虽然身在内阁，但并非全都是公务员或者技术官僚：他们是一群能把握山西关键利益集团，并将自己的能力与该省建设的某一个部分牢牢绑定起来的人。每个人都在为自己推崇的项目争取支持，而有些人也在山西动荡的政治环境中开始选边站队。\n\n这帮士绅对于山西的运作至关重要，如果我们能与他们结成盟友，那他们也会给我们带来许多好处。但值得注意的是，我们一次能够扶持的人是有限的。这就要看督理要怎么择优而取了。"
 shx.8.a: "每个人都有自己的事要做。"
 shx.9.t: "又一荒年"
 shx.9.d: "1934年来，三年大旱和洪涝毁掉了山西的农田。再加上黑色星期一对大宗商品价格的影响，晋中和晋西受到的影响尤甚。当地的财政收入不断下降，那些下层百姓也产生了强烈不满，佃农和自耕农对于维持十年计划为强加给他们的税负尤为怨念。\n\n在阎锡山的大本营陷入动荡之时，扎根陕西且常常与社会主义地下组织有联系的国民军已派出特务，开始组织农民协会或者其他运动团体。他们通过颇具说服力的煽动和一定程度有效的鼓励来尝试削弱阎锡山在该省的影响力。就连许多士绅也在抱怨阎锡山政府给予的帮助太少。在颗粒无收的一年里，很多绝望的人希望得到债务减免而避免自己的抵押物被彻底收走，或者至少政府可以同意开仓放粮。"
 shx.9.a: "国民军煽动农民不满。"
 shx.9.b: "阎锡山政府迅速组织赈灾。"
 shx.9.c: "北京提供的贷款缓解了一些痛苦。"
 shx.11.t: "十年计划继续！"
 shx.11.d: "1930年对于冯玉祥和阎锡山二人来说都是重大的转折点。他们的军队在被不断打压与羞辱之后，士气持续陷入低迷，这也迫使二人不得不进行一些反思。吴佩孚当年背水一战、做困兽之斗却最终反败为胜，这绝不能草率地归结为他的军略十分高超或是德国人把手伸得太长——晋系军阀明白，直系掌握了铁路与通讯技术，并且拥有发达的基础工业设施，这两个条件决定了他们的部队可以在两地之间调动。\n\n老天不会给他们机会犯第二次相同的错误。冯玉祥和阎锡山在相当长一段时间里都如古代传统儒家教育培养出来的官吏一般，以农业为本，农民为根。虽然两人目前仍视农业为一个重要的生产部门（冯玉祥比阎锡山更甚），但毫无疑问山西需要自己的重工业基础来与北京或是沈阳这样的得到广泛外来资助的城市竞争。而在这个问题上，阎锡山比冯玉祥的想法要更加坚定——他对全面投资发展重工业的要求甚至让欧洲的极权主义者都感到震撼。山西在过去几年间为这个项目投入了大量的政治与经济资本（虽然其动力和成效都起伏不定）\n\n孙传芳统治的倒台至少目前来说放松了吴佩孚对中国的控制。然而，毫无疑问的是，西方对于现状的影响力正在逐渐减弱，而北京政府近十年的蛰伏意味着，如果吴佩孚最终幸免遇难甚至屹立不倒，那1936年前的日子对于山西来说将一去不返。因此山西必须发展自己的经济基础，从直系等势力手中巩固自己在北方的地位。\n\n此外，十年计划也促使阎锡山、冯玉祥，还有他们两人盟友之间的不断地激烈竞争。两人都试图用这项规模宏大、包罗万象的计划来巩固他们对省份的控制，并在山西民众间建立自己的政治、经济和社会影响力。毫无疑问，这项十年计划将决定山西乃至中国未来的成败。"
 shx.11.a: "十年计划的目标是什么呢？"
 shx.11.b: "十年计划的机制是怎样的？"
 shx.11.c: "我们必胜！（继续游戏）"
 shx.12.t: "十年计划的目标"
 shx.12.d: "十年计划有两个目标，一是实现山西的工业化；二是扭转山西与中国其他地区的贸易逆差。第一个目标已经实现了一部分，但是近十年来的围绕太原而振兴本地工业的努力正因腐败和战乱停滞不前。尽管有这些弊病存在，但是在这里获取工业革命的原材料与英国却大不相同——激增的人口、便宜易得的煤炭、一定规模的城市化和不到十年的政治稳定提供了优厚的基础条件。不过问题在于其他所有中国势力也几乎拥有这一优势，因此让第二个问题浮出了水面：贸易逆差。大量资金不断流出山西，流入了北京和德国商人的腰包。煤油、纺织品和烟草制品等外来产品涌入山西，打压了许多当地产业（就算山西奉行极强的保护主义），请经济萧条会促使发达国家的倾销进一步加速。甚至连山西本地种大烟的都被那些外面来的海洛因、吗啡贩子给打败了。\n\n为了继续实现上述两个终极目标，山西的经济规划者提出了三个短期目标：教育改革、农业改革与工商改革。阎锡山和冯玉祥对于如何实现这些目标有着各自的想法，当你浏览相关国策时，将会得到的更多的内容和新的信息。就算对山西进行总动员，其资源仍然十分紧张。而最稀缺的资源就是时间，因此山西必须对每个部门的投资规模尽快做出决定——不过三心二意的努力从来都无法在该省实现真正的变革。"
 shx.12.a: "告诉我这项计划的背景。"
 shx.13.t: "十年计划的机制"
 shx.13.d: "在玩法内容上，十年计划提供了山西早期游戏内容中的大部分内容（内政和军事国策树是剩下一部分）。十年计划的每项改革都是如下模式——完成一个国策将会出现新的决议，新决议将会提供一些背景介绍并允许你在两个方向中做出选择。同时还将启动一个决议倒计时，以反映山西在各项改革上取得的进展。国策树每个分支的“主要”部分都将提供一些围绕的附加国策，完成他们通常会提供额外奖励，但更重要的是可以让你做出一些付更大代价来加快改革的抉择。这些国策并不是必须的，你也可以优先其他主要国策。但如果你想改革进度，就不得不选择他们，这样可以让山西更好地为未来的战争做好准备。另外请注意，在完成一个改革的重点分支后，许多加速改革的决议会立刻消失。\n\n该系统也与派系间的政治内容紧密相关。因为你选择的每个国策、决议或出现的事件都可能加强阎锡山或冯玉祥，并让他们最终大权在握，而决定权就在玩家手中。不过，在一段时间内维持两人的权力平衡可能更加有利——因为反对派会选择国策树分支的另一侧，并提供一个弱化版的奖励。不过一旦一方彻底夺权，那么将不能再选择任何与其利益相左的国策（已经开始的不会被取消）。另外，当双方权力平衡尚未达到95%-100%时，双方发起对对方的清洗或是革命都会影响稳定性。\n\n北京的影响力是这个小游戏机制中的最后一个。北京如果有较高的影响力，则可以征用山西的民用工厂，但也会给山西提供强大的经济buff。对于早战玩家来说，最好避免北京的影响力过高。然而，那些寻求长期准备的玩家，可能北京带来的buff会很有用。鉴于直奉战争的不确定性以及山西本身资源的匮乏，时机的选择对于成功至关重要。"
 shx_mil.1.t: "邀请外国顾问"
 shx_mil.1.d: "众所周知，过去的一个世纪中，中国军队的素质都十分低下，大部分士兵在开战的那一刻就想着怎么借机逃跑。晋系军阀的武装力量比其他省份要好一些，但也没好到哪去。\n\n因此，许多[SHX.GetLeader]的顾问提议请外国顾问来训练山西的军队。山西作为一个内陆省份，自古就不太受外来地区影响，排外主义情绪也普遍盛行，不过并不激进。事实上，虽然当地仍盛行反帝国主义，但也肯定仍是愿意学习世界各国的先进作战方式的。\n\n我们已同德国顾问（曾训练过清军和八省联合军）、俄罗斯顾问以及日本顾问接洽。虽然我们需要他们的军事援助和指导，但也必须警惕他们带来的潜在后果。毫无疑问，寻求德国人的帮助会在得到高质量训练的同时也打开我们的省界，并让我们受到更多的直系影响。而需求俄国或是日本人的顾问的帮助则有可能变相鼓励国民军那样的民族主义者。"
 shx_mil.1.a: "邀请俄国人！"
 shx_mil.1.b: "邀请日本人！"
 shx_mil.1.c: "邀请德国人！"
 shx_mil.2.t: "政治训导的模式"
 shx_mil.2.d: "一名普通的中国士兵不会关心自己头上的长官、将军是谁，或是他们效忠哪一路军阀。他关心的只有自己能拿到多少军饷、能给在贫困乡村里的家人赚来多少食物和钱财，对民族主义或者国家荣誉则是一无所知。\n\n为了提高军队素质，[SHX.GetLeader]领导下的最高军事指挥决定采取西方的模式，向军中派遣政委，对新兵进行道德指导与政治训话，并将政治工作与军事工作合二为一。\n\n阎锡山为了发扬自己的理念，提议以洗心社来负责政治工作的指导。军官们被要求与士兵打成一片，了解他们的出身背景，并且要灌输阎锡山混合着儒家文化和现代化要素的矛盾思想。\n\n另一边，冯玉祥则提出由国民军军官担任政治工作的模式。他们不会宣传阎锡山关于美德和秩序的理念，而是向新兵们灌输民族主义的意识，唤醒山西人民，让他们从帝国主义手中拯救国家。此外，冯玉祥也建议军官们直接从基督教的教义中汲取劝导，并指导山西军人如何以道德且正义的方式对待平民。"
 shx_mil.2.a: "参考冯大帅的模式！"
 shx_mil.2.b: "阎长官的方法才是正确的！"
 shx_mil.3.t: "兵农合一"
 shx_mil.3.d: "[SHX.GetLeader]渴望在即将到来的对抗强权的军事行动中取得胜利，因此他提出了一个名为“兵农合一”的宏伟计划。他宣布正式废除土地私有制，并将收来的土地平均分给十八至四十八岁的成年健康男性。他们三人为一组进行工作，每个人都要在[SHX.GetNameDef]的军队中服役至少几年，而他的同伴则负责他在被征召期间耕种他空出来的土地。\n\n虽然这被标榜为爱国主义的行为，但是实际上却严重剥夺了农民的权力。他们被禁止离开自己的土地，且几乎一生要受到军事纪律的约束。除了定期的军事训练外，农民和地主所要上交的税负也大大增加。后者对此尤其反对，在考虑到他们之前被征收的税款则更是如此，因为他们无法亲自耕种的土地将会被全部征用，换来的却只是微薄的收入。"

 shx_mil.4.t: "山西省空军构想"
 shx_mil.4.d: "鉴于我们缺乏足够的资金、经验和适宜该项目的基建，如果我们在这个过去几十年由外国列强参与的空军发展中置身事外，也很少会有人因此责怪我们。但是无论如何，[SHX.GetLeader]还是决定要在天空之上保卫主权，希冀能够在建立国内航空工业的同时，拥有一个属于我们自己的空军。\n\n我们购置了一小批训练用飞机，并将学员送往临时训练设施之中，这些人是我们省内最先一批接触到军用航空技术的人。省内出现了不同的声音，讨论起是否将其他学员送往[QIE.GetNameDef]的专业学校学习或者雇佣外界的佣兵来帮助训练。然而就目前而言，在孩子们习惯在天空中翱翔之前，人们保持着对上天的敬畏。"

 shx_mil.5.d: "随着[KOR.GetNameDef]的解放，自1926年一直在我省担任空军教官的朝鲜志愿飞行员安昌男决定回到他刚刚获得解放的祖国。安昌男出身于朝鲜，在日本学习飞行，虽然他此后就在日本担任飞行教官，但在1923年目睹关东大地震后日本人对朝鲜的屠杀后，他决心与日本帝国主义作斗争。安昌南一路穿越中国并与阎锡山见面，在阎锡山的委托下帮助山西空军实现了现代化，他还参加了抗日战争。现在，朝鲜终于解放了——他也没必要留在山西了。他在告别仪式上与他的战友们还有[SHX.GetLeader]挥泪告别，然后同几名朝鲜志愿者一起返回了祖国。"
 shx_mil.5.a: "我们会想你的！"
 shx_pol.1.t: "山西的未来走向"
 shx_pol.1.d: "阎督理曾经坦言过山西的现状：“政治自政治，人民自人民。政府不在乎老百姓，所以老百姓也不在乎政府。”\n\n诚然，无论是阎派的进步论调或者国民军的革命论调，在这几十年间，对于山西的老百姓其实没有太大的影响。人们依然无休无止地在田间劳作，阶级上升的机会渺茫，而为两位巨头所做的牺牲也看不到什么回报。地方官僚的腐败更是无可救药，少数两袖清风的好官最终也不过是在为头顶上的腐败政府服务。而阎锡山则一直以慈父般的作风清理政府内部，并以受儒家理想启发的愿景来围绕自己建立个人崇拜。阎锡山受日本教育，对多元化政治极度不信任，他认为那是无政府主义的前兆，而民主则只是用来吸引民众关注的噱头。国民军的激进运动则更加助长了阎锡山的怀疑，他们承诺一场民族主义与民粹主义的革命，但是在已经控制的土地上仍在进行威权统治——这创造了一种二元权力体系，并随时冲击着山西省权力结构的稳定。\n\n在这两位巨头之间夹着的，是成千上万彷徨犹豫的知识分子、城市工人、官僚、商人和千千万万的老百姓，这些人仍在中国最贫穷的省份之一中苦苦生活。两人都声称，只要人民给他们足够的权力与信心，他们就能成为拯救山西乃至中国的人。随着权力斗争愈演愈烈，每家每户都在为意识形态、战争、革命、进步，以及最基本的生计问题而挣扎。变革之风已然开始吹拂……"

 shx_pol.2.d: "由于十年计划的压力和阎冯间的对立，山西的政治氛围正变得越来越紧张。督理和他的手下决定消灭省内反对派，因此加强了经济控制和政治施压。他们要求各县的县长定期前往省城汇报接受规训，罢免非亲信人员。各地的乡贤也收到了任命，不过乡贤们可不怎么高兴，毕竟没几个人喜欢被“规训”的。\n\n阎锡山还模仿日本和不列颠联盟的管理体系建立了一支秘密警察部队，保安局。在过去的几年间，保安局已经扩充到了一万多人，最近也在向各乡设立办公机构，同时招募了一支保安团作为辅助部队。预计这些这支秘密警察部队将由警长南佩兰带领，虽然他麾下的警察队伍已经够大了。根据内幕消息，计划中每二十五个家庭就要有一名警察，且若有必要可实行“恐怖统治”来维持秩序。不过这计划已经没那么好使了，冯玉祥正鼓励他的儿童团和青年团“对等监视”。尽管与极权主义和军团主义所颂扬的警察国家相去甚远，但山西的进步并非毫无代价。"

 shx_pol.10.d: "The state of nationalism in a nation divided by decades of warlordism is complicated. Few dare to question the idea that there is a single Chinese nation, but nationalism as an intellectual concept is relatively new, especially in relatively isolated regions such as Shanxi. There is an unfortunate tendency in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to slander every supporter of the central government as being in the pocket of corporate interests or bowing to the boot of a corrupt dictatorship. This perception is reinforced by the lethargic state of the Harmony Association's regional branch, the most charitable interpretation being that the routine harassment of provincial authorities forces them to keep their activities discreet. However, there are plenty who align with Beijing for other reasons. For many nationalistic intellectuals, Chinese unity is paramount to other concerns and regionalism is to be condemned. Shanxi's government, for their part, have regularly utilised nationalism to their ends. Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun is named after the concept, and promotes a nationalistic, populist vision that condemns foreign imperialism and seeks to reverse the century of humiliation. Yan has also utilised nationalism for his ends, decrying imperialism and extorting China to maintain military readiness against foreign invasion. Shrines honouring Guan Yu and Yue Fei dot the countryside, and patriotism is lionised by Shanxi's authorities.\n\nOn the other hand however, Shanxi jealously guards its privileges. Distrust for the central government is rampant among the province's leadership, with most attempts at asserting national unity being undermined by fears of central government overreach. Regionalism, to many villagers, does not mean secessionism or even is seen as contradictory to the Chinese identity - while many disliked Governor Yan they were similarly steadfast against any outside replacement. After all, he is one of them - a local son.\n\nToday, as Shanxi navigates its place in the world, the people must come to a conclusion as to what they value more."

 shx_pol.11.d: "基督教在山西多种多样的信仰中相当年轻，可它的影响力绝对不小。作为一个全球性的宗教，它有着许多脱胎于纳匝肋的耶稣的教义的宗派。基督教的传教士常常来到山西传教，并在军阀混战的年代提供人道援助。这些外国传教士常常参与学校、医院或是一些重建项目的工作，虽然工作质量参差不齐，但仍赢得了许多省民的感谢。\n\n但对于阎锡山来说，宗教仅仅是统治大众的工具，他曾经指出“天老爷那么远，遇事叫他也不灵。”阎锡山很多次提出反对人们上天主教学校，并试图建立一座本土化的天主教堂。尽管如此，他还是和传教士们有所联系，有时阎锡山会向传教士们寻求建议并允许他们在洗心会上发言（但禁止直接提及上帝）。其中最值得关注的在山西开办学校的欧柏林学院和中国内地会。\n\n而在国民军阵营中，冯玉祥本人就是一名坚定的基督徒，但他坚称加入他的并不必信教。国民军常常把基督教的教义吸纳到自己的规诫中，而冯玉祥的太太则是北京中华基督教青年会的组织者，但冯玉祥还是没有任何有组织的教派直接结盟。事实上，冯玉祥是比阎锡山以更微妙的方式将基督教当作自己维护道德秩序的工具，他承认，他关注的是信仰的现实意义，而非神学教义。他对于外国传教士，尤其是天主教的传教士一直评价较低，并指责他们在教会的庇护下窝藏罪犯。\n\n对于不了解这两位巨头的人来说，基督教则是他二人谦逊的信仰，是山西人信仰中的一种，是在风雨欲来的中国为平民百姓提供慰藉的信仰。"
 shx_pol.11.a: "疲乏的，他赐能力；软弱的，他加力量。"
 shx_pol.12.t: "山西的儒家思想"
 shx_pol.12.d: "One of the bedrocks of Chinese social and political philosophy is Confucianism, a collection of philosophies, doctrines, and governing principles developed by the Chinese scholar Confucius. Described by some as a philosophy, a way of life, and/or a religion, under Yan Xishan neo-Confucian thought is the cornerstone of his syncretic ideology. Feng Yuxiang for example, despite his Christian conversion, like many of his fellow Chinese takes Confucian principles for granted as the basis for his worldview, taking particular interest in caring for the laobaixing. To him, Christian and Confucian social principles differ little, and Christianity just happens to be more effective in their practices. Notably, while Buddhist and Daoist temples were ransacked by GMJ forces in the past, Confucian temples were always left undisturbed.\n\nYan, along with his chief ideologue Zhao Daiwen views the harmonious principles and calls for moderation embedded in Confucian thought as integral to solving the rampant social disorder and societal decay caused by the warlord era. The Heart Washing Society, seen by many as an attempt to revive the Confucian church, has received significant patronage from Yan during his tenure as governor.\n\nThat said, however, in many ways Yan has broken from his Confucian upbringing, even as he claims to be reviving it. In particular, his emphasis on the state and village over the needs of the family has drawn some ire, particularly as the Ten Year Plan progresses. Much of the authority traditionally bestowed on a Chinese father has been stripped away and the practice of arranged marriage has been suppressed as the youth have been encouraged to marry freely. At one point, the Governor has even proposed reburying the dead in village cemeteries so as to utilise plots of land previously used for family graveyards - an affront to Confucian tradition.\n\nHis open view of struggling against nature and attempt to subjugate the natural order similarly clashes with Confucian views of harmony, some of his followers going so far as to cast Confucius as a promoter of science and economic progress. Perhaps most tellingly, Yan's government has eliminated \"moral character\" as a criterion to enter the administration, believing technical competence on a large scale will do far more for the state than any Confucian-inspired morality."
 shx_pol.12.a: "家齐而后国治。"
 shx_pol.13.t: "山西的佛教教诲"
 shx_pol.13.d: "Buddhism is another major religion in Shanxi, a faith that emerges from the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha). Followers seek to overcome suffering through Buddhism's tenets, and the predominant denomination of the religion in China is a form of Mahayana Buddhism sometimes referred to as Han Buddhism. In the context of Shanxi's social climate, Buddhism's most prominent adherent within the government is Zhao Daiwen, one of Yan Xishan's chief lieutenants and mentors. Yan Xishan's experiences in Japan soured his outlook on Buddhism, seeing it as complacent and superstitious, and upon taking power in 1911 he initially attempted to destroy their temples and tear down their idols in favour of the Heart Washing Society. The public backlash was tremendous and Yan was forced to retreat, a testament to Buddhism's continued influence even in face of major political upheaval.\n\nFeng Yuxiang and the Guominjun saw a similar phase of anti-Buddhist activism. Feng's men have a history of looting Buddhist temples, converting others into schools for their own uses - to them Buddhism often represents a stagnant, \"old\" Chinese culture that failed them. To General Feng, Buddhism's chief utility is discouraging his men from fearing death. This adversarial relationship has continued over into the Guominjun's stay in Shaanxi, and they count few supporters among the Buddhist establishment.\n\nYan has taken a different route, perhaps because of the influence of Zhao or perhaps because of his desire for stability. He has attempted to cement his control over the Buddhist hierarchy, establishing Buddhist associations in every district headed by a loyalist priest. In Taiyuan's Chongshan temple, one of his crucial loyalists has been installed as the abbot, and Buddhist rituals have been strategically incorporated into the Heart Washing Society's weekly practices. It is unclear if these efforts to win over the Buddhists have been successful, but their support is essential for ruling the province."

 shx_pol.14.t: "山西的探寻之“道”"
 shx_pol.14.d: "There are plenty of less influential faiths in Shanxi, with a variety of adherents. Perhaps the largest is Daoism, a Chinese school of thought centred around \"the Way\" and taking considerable influence from Lao Tzu (\"the Old Master\") and his writings. Similar to Buddhism, Daoist temples have been raided by the Guominjun in the past and have received some limited patronage from Governor Yan. In particular the \"Court of the Way\" cult has been used in the past as a vehicle for Yan's attempts at social control. Their belief that their seances with the spirits of the dead, including not only traditional Chinese figures such as Confucius and Lao Tzu but also Abraham Lincoln and the Virgin Mary, represent a unique branch of the Daoist faith.\n\nOther smaller faiths include the \"Three Sects Faith\", a syncretic religion formulated from Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhist ideas. This sect exhorts its followers to \"do good\" along Confucian lines to acquire a fortune. Islam also has a presence in the region, with a small but present Hui minority. Yan has been accused by others of attempting to formulate a Chinese version of the Shintoism he saw while studying in Japan, fusing Confucian thought with nationalism.\n\nOf course, like most of China, Chinese folk religions (often co-existing with or incorporating Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism), often focusing on ancestor veneration and/or nature, holds the vast majority of the religious scene. The dynamism of all of these faiths, and the interaction between these various beliefs provide an insight into the cultural backdrop of Shanxi's political wars."

 shx_pol.16.d: "Perhaps the most visible manifestation of Governor Yan's social agenda is the Heart Washing Society, a pseudo-religious organisation dedicated to creating a unified social morality. Meeting every Sunday in a temple, participants led by local authorities meditated and listen to sermons. The subjects and themes were frequently drawn from Confucian works, however, plenty of inspiration was taken from Buddhist and Christian beliefs as well. In particular, Yan urged a belief in a supreme being he claims has a basis in Confucianism, but contains concepts likely drawn from Christianity such as divine retribution for wrong-doing and a spiritual \"rebirth\" for adherents.\n\nPerhaps the most iconic part of this society's practices, however, is their practice of publicly confessing weekly misdeeds in front of one another. The congregation is invited to criticise the wrongdoer and castigate them for their crimes.\n\nOnce rather dormant, especially following Yan's defeat in the 1920s wars and the ensuing political catastrophe, it appears the society is once more out in force. Led by fanatics who remained loyal to the cause, this sudden burst in faith is most certainly connected to a state-sponsored push. Nonetheless, in these trying times, perhaps a little faith is necessary for the people to pull through with their tribulations."

With subjects such as \"What Families Must Know\", \"What Village Headsmen Must Know\", \"General Information for Merchants\" and of course, \"What People Must Know\", each of these books provides detailed instructions for the consumption of the people in his domain.\n\nYan has also sponsored a variety of newspapers tied to his government, including the daily \"Village Talk\" and his lectures, slogans and sayings regularly are disseminated across the province to varying levels of enthusiasm through posters, travelling plays and newspapers.

 shx_pol.19.d: "Governor Yan has developed over the decades an eclectic ideology, with inspiration drawn from a variety of different sources. But as he seeks to enshrine his legitimacy not only in his province but on a national level, more and more the \"Model Governor\" must demonstrate that he is more than a savvy political operator or a cunning military officer. He must demonstrate that he is a leader, not only of men but of thought. And so, Governor Yan has begun to write down conclusively his thoughts for the future.\n\nYan Xishan's \"Philosophy of China\" begins with four guiding principles. 1. Self-preservation and self-reliance is both the ultimate goal and means by which China will be liberated. 2. Ensuring prosperity and profit are crucial for ensuring the well-being of the nation. 3. Being flexible and accepting contradiction is the best way to ensure the consolidation of one's rule 4. Be unconventional, independent and special, and show individuality when tackling the ever-flowing situation.\n\nHaving grown distant from Sun Yat-sen's ideology and long broken with the philosopher's party, Yan proposes a new version of the Three Principles of the People, one updated for the circumstances China finds itself in: Virtue, Knowledge and Welfare. As he continues his treatise, he unveils his designs for his homeland. A vision of a stable, prosperous and free China - built on the foundations of order, proper morals, and above all the obedience and faith of the people for their \"Model Governor\"."

 shx_pol.20.d: "Although hardly a syndicalist and wary of socialist influence, Feng Yuxiang decided to cast his lot with the Kuomintang in the fateful years of the 1920s. 1925 saw Feng Yuxiang study Dr Sun Yat-sen's lectures, particularly on the Three Principles of the People, and he saw it as a useful tool to bolster the control of his Guominjun army. Dr Sun's timely death in 1925 meant he was never a serious rival to Feng as a potential leader among northern revolutionary forces, and Feng widely distributed Dr Sun's lectures to his men.\n\nFeng's relationship with the Dr Sun's successors and his Kuomintang was icier, an alliance of convenience that Feng hoped would give him access to sea following the Northern Expedition (and perhaps some Internationale funding). Feng seems to have only used Dr Sun's works on the Three Principles (which conveniently rarely mentions the Kuomintang), and was rumoured to have been mulling making a play for leadership of the party after Sun's death. Despite Kuomintang insistence, few in Feng's inner circle expected him to subordinate himself to the KMT (if anything, he hoped for the opposite), and the mutual defeat in the Northern Expedition rendered the point moot.\n\nStill, an alliance of sorts remains in the North - built in Feng's vision with the KMT as a junior partner to the much larger GMJ. The various Kuomintang groups (in particular the Reorganised Comrades Association) tend to find safe harbour in the Guominjun's ranks and provide an active, energetic left flank to Feng Yuxiang's movement."

With death and injury common in a nation trapped in the throes of civil war, martyrdom is an all too common theme within the Guominjun ranks. Feng has established an Association for the Study of the Methods of Comforting to provide for both crippled soldiers and the families of the deceased. Military YMCAs bear the names of fallen officers and enlisted alike in bronze plaques along with notices of valour on the battlefield, while grand marble stones in drill fields likewise memorialise the dead.\n\nElsewhere, Christian-inspired charities and welfare institutions have been established by Feng's men. Nurseries for unwanted, illegitimate and orphaned children have been built for those under five along with dedicated orphanages for those between five and fifteen to learn trade skills. Homes for the blind, crippled, and elderly are also run by the Guominjun, along with shelters for the working poor like coolies.\n\nHygiene too is important, with fly-killing campaigns regularly initiated within Guominjun camps. Bathhouses for poor workers to clean themselves and their clothing after long days similarly dot Yan'an. All of these efforts, while perhaps holding idealistic foundations, also have pragmatic effects. They have won over many of the laobaixing to Feng's cause, and they will fight for him."

The Department was rendered largely defunct with Feng's renouncement of his Kuomintang membership at the end of the Northern Expedition. Now, however, with Feng soon to be locked in a battle for control over Northern China, it becomes as necessary as ever for him to harness all the allies he can across the revolutionary spectrum. Feng has once again reactivated the department, filling it with crucial allies and encouraging its zeal.\n\nThe Political Department is once again establishing offices in each army, division, and brigade and deploying political officers from regiments down to platoons. On a platoon level, political cells are being organised. In practice, implementation has been hampered as it did in 1927 by a lack of ideologically trained personnel and inconsistent expectations for staff and roles. Some have interpreted this move as creating political officers, while others see the department as a propaganda arm. The ambiguity however does not diminish the rising radicalisation of the Guominjun and its preparation for a national revolution."

Say all of you, is that just?\n A: It is not\nQ13: If those who love idleness, but also enjoy said luxuries while engaging in wild profligacy and extravagance, say you, men, is it just?\nA: It is not\nQ14: Since this is so, what should you do?\nA: We shall advocate justice\nQ15: How will you advocate justice?\nA: We shall have everyone have food, clothing, homes and money.\nQ16:Where will you begin in order to carry out this programme?\nA: Our first step is to not harass and not let others harass the commoners. Our second is to secure land and employment for the people.\nQ17:And what more should be done?\nA: Workers shall eat, toilers shall eat, but the idle shall meet with our intervention!\n\nOther sections include a copy of Sun Yat-sen's will, the Wuyuan Oath, and reflective questions on sacrifice, duty, and anti-Imperialism. This populist agenda, widely popular among the commoners, intellectuals and even members of the gentry, has spread far and wide, greatly enhancing Feng's reputation in the province."

My only desire is to love the people!\"\n\nIn one final push for Shanxi's destiny, Yan himself has travelled across the province, organising massive campaign-style rallies often attended by entire towns and regions. Accompanying him are large bands playing cheery songs such as the \"Hymn to the Federation of Municipalities and Workers\", energising the audience and creating a festival-like atmosphere. In addition to stops in Shanxi proper, he boldly moved his speeches into the Guominjun powerbase itself in Shaanxi, holding one of such rallies in Yan'an while any dissenters could do nothing but watch.\n\nHe concluded his tour with an address in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where hundreds of thousands (perhaps over a million) citizens listened as the speakers praised the governor's efforts at building a \"paradise\" in their province, while the Governor himself spoke at length about the future he promises for the faithful. Afterwards, Yan's finest soldiers and many students from Taiyuan's universities marched down the streets under torchlight, shouting their slogans and waving signs in support of their leader. This show of strength, while not necessarily winning over any enemies he has made, has at least solidified recognition that Yan stands as the master of Shanxi."

We swear it!\"\n\nOn September 17th, 1926 in the town of Wuyuan, Suiyuan, Feng Yuxiang stood before his men and delivered that oath. The situation was not kind to him at the time, Guominjun troops had been pushed out of Beijing earlier that year by a resurgent Zhili force. But as the Kuomintang began their northern expedition, Feng Yuxiang saw his chance, and on that day swore his men over to the cause of Dr Sun Yat-sen.\n\nMany years have passed, but while delivering his speech today before the gathered Guominjun remnants, Feng could not help but reference it once again. He assures the crowd that he has not forgotten the oath, nor will the Guominjun ever forget. The tyranny that grips China will be shattered, and the nation rebuilt for the people. After he finished, just like then in 1926, the crowd roared with cheers of \"Down with the foreign powers! Root out the warlords!\", a cry so resounding that it took several minutes to quiet down.\n\nDr. Sun's successors have long proven themselves unworthy, but the man's principles continue to stand. The people of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and all the thousands of loyalists that have followed Feng Yuxiang over the years shall fight for a China free of imperialists and warlords!"

Working from a foundation built during earlier reform periods in Yan's rule and inspired by Feng's ambitious mass education programmes during his campaigns, Shanxi's young children now have access to a modern curriculum across the entire province. This access includes the most desolate, poorest regions of the province, which have received government funding and trained teachers brave enough to bring modernity to even the most underserved. At school, students are taught not only how to read and write using newspapers and government circulars (an accomplishment on its own), but also practical vocational skills such as animal husbandry, arithmetic, agricultural sciences, craftsmanship, and technical skills. Other life skills such as ethics, hygiene, childcare, and languages such as English, Japanese and Classical Chinese all round out to one modern education for the Chinese people.\n\nChildren are not the only ones benefiting from Shanxi's ambitious education programme. Adults who have spent their entire life toiling in the fields or factories are finally given an opportunity to advance themselves by taking night classes and learning how to read for themselves. Women's education, which has long been neglected and treated as secondary, has seen a revival in educational focus - with higher enrolment of women in primary schooling. Although there remains much to be done about the quality of education in Shanxi, and higher education has begun to lag, few can doubt that Shanxi is considerably better off than it was at the start of the decade."

 shx_edu.1.d: "To say education in Shanxi is lacking would be quite an understatement. While few will doubt that Shanxi's government has made considerable strides in the first decade or so of Yan's rule reducing illiteracy, wars and disruption have sapped away the funding necessary to keep up the momentum Shanxi's previous push for educational attainment had created.\n\nAt the primary level, many students refuse to attend class despite the mandate for all students to attend four years of schooling, staying home to help at farms or learning a trade. Many schools are underfunded and hastily built, contributing to a negative perception of these schoolhouses. The middle schools are scarcely better: ever since Zhao Daiwen's harsh and draconian rule as Principal of the People's Normal School spawned a mass student uprising, the government has lived in terror of future unrest. The government has since lost most control over these schools - students regularly cheat on exams and intimidate teachers that don't give easy scores or are seen as too foreign. The Student Association, once established to protest Yan's authoritarianism and also Western Imperialism in 1925, has grown corrupt and directionless over the years, standing for little except halting changes to the status quo.\n\nHigher education is no different - Shanxi University is effectively a vast, government-funded resort where professors gamble their meagre wages with their students, and teachers are so incompetent that the mechanical engineering professor was useless when the University power plant went out. Foreign professors and those trained in the West, Beijing and Japan all regularly fight, while corruption soars.\n\nWith all of these numerous issues, it is clear that perfect is the enemy of good. Shanxi is best off focusing its efforts in a limited scope for now, and after deliberation that will be..."

Many of these go on to work for foreign firms, or stay close to the coast where they can make a better living and enjoy the western luxuries they have grown accustomed to. Indeed, Shanxi's government used to sponsor select students to go abroad until they found that returning students have grown too rebellious and accustomed to Western living. Shanxi has instead attempted to focus on training students at home - to questionable success.\n\nAs the province pursues educational reforms, Zhao Pilian (the Principal of the People's Normal School and de facto Minister of Education) has put out the word that Shanxi University is hiring. Few have responded, and fewer are men of good quality, but one has stood out - Ren Zhigong (also known as CK Jen), a youngish scholar at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\n\nA man born to poverty in Shanxi, he went through the early stages of Shanxi's educational system before being admitted to Tsinghua at age 15 in 1921. He went on to study at MIT, the University of Pennsylvania and acquired a PhD in Physics at Harvard, all in a few years. Such a distinguished scholar was difficult to recruit, but he claims to be inspired by a sense of patriotism and by our genuine effort at reform (no doubt reinforced by our very generous paycheck). As a faculty member he has his work cut out for him - the library at Shanxi University is said to have closed due to a lack of patronage.\n\nMuch of the higher education in Shanxi (at least when things are taught) is technical in nature rather than theoretical, and the Shanxi government has demonstrated considerable mistrust towards scholars from Beijing. We will see if this young man can truly embody the spirit of Shanxi's educational dream."

 shx_edu.3.d: "Hearing about our renewed efforts at reforming education, the Shanxi Student Association has decided to order a general strike, refusing to attend class and even intimidating teachers and students that do. While there were some in our government that hoped they would be too disorganised and moribund since the last time, it appears the students are out in full force against our reforms, fearing a further loss in status. Indeed in Shanxi a frequent complaint is that middle and college graduates simply \"graduate and join the jobless\" at a time when the economy is undergoing tremendous changes and employment is scarce.\n\nThis is not the first time of course this has happened. Zhao Daiwen, a draconian Principal of the People's Normal School, was so harsh in suppressing dissent in the 1920s that he threw one of his sons in prison and exiled another for student participation - strongly distrusting Beijing-trained students. This failed to stop student radicalism, and when news came out in 1925 that the Entente intended to hand over Shandong to the Japanese, this touched off a small anti-Imperialist riot in Taiyuan, with the Student Association boycotting foreign goods. Although quickly dissipated, later when taxes were raised on students, a massive strike and rioting forced Yan to relent and fire Zhao.\n\nZhao Pilian was his replacement, and his more conciliatory approach towards students has given them greater power. Since the People's Normal School educates the teachers, this has de facto handed control of much of education to the Student Association, who have utilised their power to intimidate instructors deemed too pro-foreign, strict or otherwise angered the student body. Sometimes, strikes are called simply to prevent attending exams or to extend winter break, contributing to the breakdown of Shanxi's education system.\n\nIt appears that our efforts to reform education will require us to wrest some control back, setting us on a collision course."

While primary schooling, for all of its faults, generally sees decent attendance, middle schooling has largely been overlooked in favour of primary and higher education. Encompassing about six years of education (due to translational issues, \"Middle schooling\" in this context incorporates both middle and secondary/high school education), for many in Shanxi it is far too expensive. Indeed, given the relative lack of opportunities, students that skip school and learn practical trades in their teenage years tend to be more employable than their studious peers.\n\nThe Shanxi government, in their effort to promote education, has dramatically lowered fees for middle schooling and is even considering mandating such education in hopes of creating a modern education worker base for the Ten Year Plan's industrial sector. This has seen considerable pushback from conservatives and parents who worry about their children's prospects and resent the increase in costs. Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to look the other way sometimes."

In the 1920s, Middle school students were given uniforms, regular military training and exposed to a harsh regimen of discipline, virtue and obedience. Punishments were harsh and eventually provoked a revolt. Both strongmen remained interested in these programmes, crediting militarised schooling with allowing for Japanese ascendency.\n\nHowever, parental pushback and general disinterest have seen these programmes mostly lay fallow, with the Boy Scouts mostly wearing nice uniforms and playing soldier rather than learning to become one. Athletics remains one of the few remaining elements still in active practice, with a strong emphasis on a healthy body and the Provincial Athletic Association remaining well functioning. Attempting to reassert these militarised programmes will no doubt take time and create a certain lasting change in the culture of Shanxi. But perhaps it simply must be done."

Compounding the challenge is that the students lack a defined leader, with different groups within the Student Association pushing for various objectives. Still, some consistent student demands have emerged, including easier exams, promises of high-paying jobs, and exemptions to military service. Many students feel highly unemployable due to Shanxi's dysfunctional education system, despite the vast amount of technical job openings that they often aren't qualified for.\n\nConvincing his superiors will not be an easy task either - many of the student leaders were trained in Beijing and have radical ties. While their fears are understandable, many of their demands are simply unreasonable or contradict the goals of the Ten Year Plan - and there is no guarantee that it will appease enough students anyway. Zhao's old rival in the education department and the recently appointed chair of the Village Inspection Committee Feng Sizhi has seized this opportunity to advocate for taking a hard line, reasserting power on the delinquent students. He has found an ally in the Commissioner of Police Nan Peilan, another Yan appointee.

They were encouraged to engage in local life, attending local festivals and staging plays and running clinics in turn for the farmers. In the area where this was established, socialism was kept in check, keeping the area loyal to the government. The school even had an official journal known as \"New Village\", highlighting the dreams of progress it embodied.\n\nNow, [Root.GetLeader] hopes to expand this project and build more schools like it across the province.

Although tenantry is mostly unfeasible in many areas, in those where the land is fertile it has exacerbated inequalities - breeding considerable resentment and strengthening the domination of the gentry.\n\nInitially, Yan Xishan was a strong proponent of investing in the countryside, seeing it as a means of reversing the trade imbalance that plagues Shanxi. Indeed, Confucian classics he read tended to focus on agriculture, though prior attempts to wrest some control from the gentry had seen even members of his home town turn away when he visited. The gentry's sabotage efforts seem as hostile to their interests, while an increasing number of tenant farmers have grown sympathetic to the Guominjun since they arrived.\n\nPrior attempts at developing Shanxi's agricultural sector have earned mixed results despite (or perhaps because of) its ambitious goals, and drought has crippled Shanxi's agricultural sector every year since 1934.

While the elite still controls village leadership and much of the land, the district magistrates serve as a check and efforts to crack down on the abuse of litigation as a means of intimidation have created a sense of fairness. A token amount of land has been redistributed, growing the class of yeomen farmers.\n\nUtilising Shanxi's limited arable farmland, the farms in Shanxi produce a mixture of traditional cereals and grains as well as more profitable cash crops - notably cotton.

Another such effort includes importing Merino sheep from Australia in hopes of breeding them with the hardier but less attractive local sheep to create a Shanxi proprietary blend.

Although much credit can be given to the wisdom of prior decades-long projects of self-reliant and protectionist industrialisation policies, few can doubt that the recent addition of extensive foreign funds has been anything short of pivotal in building up Shanxi's industrial capacity. Churning out a mixture of consumer goods such as cigarettes, matches, paper and flour, as well as chemicals such as sulfates, potassium chloride and potassium carbonate, Shanxi's previously skyrocketing unemployment has plummeted. People come to [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] from across the province and beyond, learning critical technical skills in a miniature and accelerated Industrial revolution.\n\nChallenges remain of course, and much of our economy is owned by foreign business interests. But confidence in our economy is growing and it is uplifting significant numbers of people out of poverty, earning us the trust of the people of Shanxi. The next more immediate step will be to develop our mining interests, but we have come a long way towards our goal of reversing the trade deficit that has dominated our economy."

Although much credit can be given to the wisdom of prior decades-long projects of mass industrialisation, few can doubt that the latest push by the people of our province has borne considerable fruit in boosting Shanxi's industrial capacity to a competitive standard. While the primary focus of these efforts has been military and heavy industry via state planning, our factories also produce some light industry for our province's needs such as cigarettes and paper. Many of Shanxi's previously unemployed people have been mobilised to work, and our province has been gaining the technical prowess needed to build an industrial hub in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Our planners excitedly are beginning to outline new projects, and we're building momentum for a lasting change.\n\nChallenges remain of course, as our efforts to build this industry have come at a heavy cost.

 shx_industry.1.long_intro: "The bulk of Shanxi's industry is concentrated around the Taiyuan basin, and it shall be the centre of Shanxi's efforts at developing an industrial region. Shanxi for over a decade now has seen multiple efforts at industrialising the province, each starting and stopping with varying levels of success. Shanxi's business community lags behind even others in China, heavily insular and nepotistic in thinking - not well adjusted to the needs of the modern capitalistic modes of thought. This stagnancy has hurt Shanxi and stalled efforts at developing a domestic industrial base. Still, there remain quite a few state-backed factories and workshops (granted not always particularly profitable), a limited trained technical workforce, large mineral reserves of coal and iron, as well as some progress towards expanding rail connections with the rest of China."

This would mean appealing to the Beijing business community, which while still dealing with Black Monday, has some capital to invest and also have the technical skills to truly revitalise the economy. This is not without issues of course - Beijing's merchants will surely be followed by its government and moreover many have extensive partnerships with German and other Western investors. This will surely agitate the anti-concessionist and xenophobic feelings in Taiyuan, but to members of Yan's clique they have no choice."

 shx_industry.2.d: "When Yan Xishan first became governor of Shanxi in 1917, all of the province's mineral wealth was declared property of the state. Although in practice this did not mean nationalisation, with the newly formed Shanxi Bureau of Public Mines allowing private owners to do as they pleased, Shanxi's government controls shares in virtually all mines of note. Yan himself was believed to secretly hold many additional shares, helping further control the mineral wealth of the province.\n\nShanxi's large reserves and profitable industry have not been doing so well as of late, however, with war and corruption and the loss of control of Suiyuan and East Shanxi causing production to plummet. As a result, despite Shanxi's higher quality and larger reserves, Shanxi is heavily outcompeted by foreign-owned firms in Shandong and Hubei. Domestically, the wealthy further refuse to invest in coal pits unless it guarantees immediate and large profits, and the conditions at Shanxi's mines are horrendous. Quite a few miners are literally prisoners, ex-convicts sentenced to work in deadly conditions.\n\nShanxi is in desperate need of capital for its industrial programme, and its leading economic experts have proposed liquidating Shanxi's shares in unprofitable mines, arguing that it will raise money and possibly create more efficiency. Some however fear that the foreign interests that will come will plunder Shanxi and the exploitation will aggravate the already suffering people. Governor [Root.GetLeader] is called to make a decision."

Although this is mostly just talk, a recent scandal has pushed this to the limit. As Shanxi rushes to develop its domestic industry, a parallel effort is underway to expand railway connections outside of Shanxi. The perennial habit of Shanxi bureaucrats to appoint friends and family of questionable competence has come home to roost when dozens of officials in charge of the railway projects have been exposed for helping swindlers defraud the Shanxi government.\n\nFurther reports suggest that embezzlement is rampant and compensation meant for the peasants/artisans is frequently stolen attracting considerable anger. Worse, many magistrates use this project as an excuse to collect extra \"taxes\" despite clear orders to the contrary. [Root.GetLeader] is livid, but his advisors have cautioned that while harsh punishments may initially soothe public anger, bringing attention to the corruption is likely to dampen support for the Ten Year Plan in the long run."

Anger has begun to bubble in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as the rapid changes caused by the Ten Year Plan has created significant uncertainty among Shanxi's growing proletariat. Cramped living conditions, poor workplace safety, and low wages, all are adding up. Unemployed students at Shanxi University have begun to join in, causing the risk of further radicalisation and the dissemination of \"disruptive thoughts\".\n\nThe [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Municipal Labour Union has organised a general strike with the help of the Kuomintang to protest the uncertainties many of the working class are facing, accusing Shanxi's leadership of being out of touch with the people. Yan has in the past sent the army to stamp out strikes and outright banned unapproved unionisation (accusing them of being infiltrated by Syndicalists), but the large scale of these growing protests threatens to completely disrupt production if not handled correctly.\n\nSympathisers in the administration point out that Shanxi is supposed to be turning a new leaf in their march towards progress, and should the people not expect some promise of benefit out of their sacrifices? Indeed, while the union tend to be dominated by KMT-RCA figures, arresting them risks further radicalisation of the movement.

Salt is a valuable commodity in China and a critical source of revenue. While Shanxi once had a thriving salt industry of its own, those days are largely passed and salt usually comes in from outside merchants. More importantly, however, salt taxes have traditionally been the domain of the central government, and for [SHX.GetLeader] to hijack our revenue in this way is a grave insult to our authority.\n\nA potential means of retaliation has been proposed. Using large amounts of cheap salt from the coast, we can flood the provinces around Shanxi with salt at prices so low no one will buy any of Shanxi's. This will definitely burn bridges but it will cripple Shanxi's effort at raising funds. On the other hand, we could simply let this go and make a point to stress how generous we are in giving them this \"tax rebate\", reaffirming our ultimate sovereignty over Shanxi."

In retaliation, we have opted to expel some of Beijing's representatives and have increased restrictions on trade from their provinces, but the damage is likely to slow down our progress towards industrialisation."

Moreover, many engineers have sought to exploit Shanxi's rich deposits of sulphur - helping further the progress of our Ten Year Plan.

They also tend to expect an unlimited liability for debts, which further chokes industry. When money does reach an enterprising young man's hands, it is often expected that they share their recently found gains with their less diligent family members, or spend nearly all of it on lavish weddings and other displays of wealth rather than reinvest it into more capital.\n\nAll of this needs to change. However, as new investors come in, the transition has hardly been seamless. Old tactics such as induced fluctuations in currency values and usury have made for an unfriendly environment for new traders, while the old business clans complain of regular exploitation from the much more worldly and better-trained merchants from Beijing.

And yet, once again the competing factions of the Shanxi clique find themselves at the negotiating table, this time weighing the repercussions of a plot being set in motion in the national capital. Governor Yan has signed onto a pact with Manchu nobles, disillusioned intellectuals, and disaffected central army officers to utilise recent mass public protects in light of the League fiasco to topple Zhili control of the nation once and for all. If successful, a decapitation strike against Zhili high commanders Wu Peifu, Cao Kun, and Jiang Baili will leave them leaderless in the chaos.\n\nThis plot is not without risks, but the fate of Shanxi is intertwined. Should Wu find out and march out against the Shanxi clique, both the Provincial Government and the Guominjun will surely fall together. And the rewards are plenty - Feng has his doubts about the plot's actual ability to successfully consolidate control over the nation, but exploiting the opportunity to weaken the Zhili and secure critical territory in the northern Chinese plain would greatly strengthen the influence of both men.\n\nIn the presence of their senior officers, a deal is finalised between both men with infamous egos: Feng and his armies will secure their previously held territories south of the Yellow River, while Yan and his loyalists will rule over the northern section. Should they reach Beijing, Yan will depose the Manchu Emperor and the republic will be restored under their diarchy."

 shx_manchu.2.d: "Not a day after Cao Kun and Wu Peifu's bodies crumpled to the floor, the joint forces of the Shanxi Provincial Army, the Guominjun, and anti-Zhili loyalists in the Central Army swung into action. As the Manchu princes and their allies worked to secure Beijing and ward off any Fengtian intervention, the coalition forces to the west made their move. Yan Xishan ordered his provincial army, mustering every many they could to arms, under his leading commanders Fu Zuoyi and Xu Yongchang towards Eastern Shanxi, firing massive salvos against entrenched Zhili forces meant to guard the mountainous approaches. Their objectives are to secure critical railway infrastructure leading southwards and to link up with allied forces in Beijing.\n\nTo the south, in the region of Guanzhong, the Guominjun swept across the Yellow River in a daring effort against unsuspecting Shaanxi garrison forces under Governor Liu Zhenhua. Frantic Zhili efforts to reinforce the provincial capital at Xi'an were thwarted by the activation of local guerilla cells aligned with the Guominjun in the countryside, who rose up in great numbers to support Feng Yuxiang's advance. Before even the advance elements of the Guominjun could arrive, these insurgents seized the city with the support of locals.\n\nThe speed to which the coup is unfolding across the central plains has astounded even its plotters, who are now forced to contend with the very real possibility that they will be forced to actually govern northern China. Still, Jiang Baili remains at large, having escaped any efforts (if there was one) to detain him. Although Xi'an is expected to fall soon, the Zhili remnant are likely to make their stand further south from Wu's traditional powerbase in Wuhan."

Xi'an has fallen to Guominjun forces, and Feng Yuxiang has ordered his men to sweep southwest towards Wuhan. He has met fierce resistance however in the city of Luoyang as he tries to reclaim his former territory in Henan.\n\nMeanwhile, coalition forces in Beijing had split into two groups, with a large force left behind to guard the border with Fengtian while the smaller component advanced southwards to link up with their allies. Yan Xishan's Shanxi Provincial Army shattered Zhili forces guarding Eastern Shanxi, retaking full control over his native province. He has since ordered his men to rapidly push eastwards to seize the Jinghan railway, and its capture this morning marks a decisive turning point in the war.\n\nCut off from Zhili bases in Wuhan, remaining loyalists north of the Yellow River have surrendered giving the so-called \"Central Plains Alliance\" near total mastery of the north. The remaining garrisons at Baoding have surrendered to Marshal Yan, handing him control of China's premier military academy. As his subordinates mop up Zhili remnants, Yan heads to Beijing, his ambitions racing far faster than his railcar."

After weeks of fighting, the critical city in Henan did not fall until reinforcements from other coalition forces arrived to surround it from the north and east. Even then, Zhili forces mostly retreated from the city in good order, leaving the victors to now fight amongst themselves. Although Yan had promised him control of territories south of the Yellow River, the new city administration (many members of the old one), have largely bucked his commands. Efforts to replace them with revolutionaries aligned with the Guominjun have met staunch resistance from other coalition partners.\n\nThis was not the only thing concerning for the revolutionary general however. In Beijing not a week prior, Yan Xishan accepted the title of Imperial Commissioner and Commander in Chief of the Imperial Army, the honours once bestowed upon Wu Peifu. If Yan was planning to depose the Emperor, as he had promised, he certainly was taking his time. Confronted with the very real possibility that he was going to be betrayed, Feng Yuxiang summoned his Thirteen Taibao for a new plan.\n\nLaunching a coup within a coup, the \"Traitor General\" forestalled any future perfidy with an aggressive assault into Shanxi, hoping to knock out Yan's power base before he could consolidate power. Having rapidly redeployed his forces, the sudden advance into Western Shanxi caught Provincial Army forces by surprise, perhaps aided by the defection of staunch republican officers like Shang Zhen, charged with holding rear positions. Taiyuan itself has been lightly secured by anti-socialist militias rallied by local gentry members.\n\nWith shots already fired and the Guominjun bearing down on the new Imperial Commissioner's headquarters in Taiyuan, a new phase of the war has opened. Neither side is particularly equipped for a conflict this size, both already exhausted by the fighting against the Zhili and overstretched by the territory they have absorbed. Still, whatever the outcome the fate of northern China will likely be determined in the coming months."

This ceasefire at the status quo will allow for Feng to consolidate his position (and likely prepare for another offensive against Yan), and for Yan to finish off the Zhili.\n\nNeither particularly are pleased with the outcome, but a continuation risks Feng losing to the superior resources of the Qing government over time and Yan potentially wasting critical resources fighting for impoverished mountains. The Zhili remnant may be effectively vanquished, but the weakness of their replacement has concerned many. The threat of Japan and their Fengtian lapdogs loom, as does the rumblings of various challengers in the south.\n\nThe balance of power in northern China, once seen as considerably more stable than the various provinces in the former League, has irrevocably shifted. In what direction this will take however, remains to be seen."

The foolish men we have decided to ally with bungled their mission, were discovered and have since been purged by a vengeful Jade Marshal. Under interrogation they revealed our involvement, not that our amassed supplies and mobilised armies did not give that away. The Zhili are coming for their revenge, and we have little time to prepare.\n\nAll hope is not lost, though we are in a position of severe disadvantage. As was before, our province is guarded by two powerful (if diminished) armies on their own right. It is too late to pursue any large-scale integration, but a joint command has been hurriedly erected in Taiyuan between Guominjun and Provincial Army generals. With the mountains and rivers to protect us, our wise commanders, and the courage of our soldiers, we might be able to keep the Central Army at bay.\n\nBe warned though, that this conflict will not end any time soon.

Instead, we are forced to find a base of operations for the future until unification.\n\nIn the past the Guominjun has had its headquarters in Yan'an, in the northern part of Shaanxi province. A smaller city, it is the base in which our army has operated from and is far more secure from enemy invasion. Our existing infrastructure exists there, and it is likely an effective war-time base.\n\nWe have also recently captured the historic city of Xi'an, one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. In addition to its historic importance, it is also connected to vital rail infrastructure. The people in the area are generally sympathetic to us thanks to prior work in earning their trust, but it is vulnerable to enemy counter attack. Moreover, its actual importance in Chinese politics has declined over the last few centuries, with the massacre of Manchus in the city during the revolution further destroying its value.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] must make a choice soon, as we work to establish some sort of impromptu military infrastructure to replace the ones we lost in Taiyuan. Using whatever our loyalists could smuggle out of the city from Taiyuan Arsenal as well as existing workshops we had, it will have to do as we fight off reactionary forces."

Workers have been laid off, businessmen struggle to find buyers, and unemployed intellectuals grow restless. Something needs to be done to stem the disastrous wave of layoffs, lest discontent turns to anger.\n\nA new option has recently emerged, with the approval of a considerable relief package from the National Assembly offering considerable aid to our people in mitigating the effects of Black Monday. This is not a scenario without worry, however. There are considerable strings attached to this package, and although financial in nature they carry considerable political undertones.

While these investors have touted the increased efficacy in our commercial and manufacturing sectors thanks to their superior management and technical capabilities, many locals cannot help but feel cheated. Small merchants fearing the loss of their livelihoods have coalesced around nationalistic groups, while workers dreading further abuses by their distant bosses have sought the protection of the socialists.\n\nAppeals have come into the Governor's office imploring him to do something to put a stop to these conglomerates. The cabinet is heavily divided, with defenders noting that this was the desired efficiency the government sought in the first place, and moreover that these companies have done nothing wrong. Others however worry about the unrest this has stoked in the people, moreover worrying that the central government is the true power behind these multi-national conglomerates.

A large consortium organised in Beijing (no doubt with some political intervention) has begun to consolidate their Shanxi holdings into a few industrial syndicates. Workers and regionalists protest that these moves by large businesses have created a de facto monopoly - the very thing we sought to avoid by selling off state shares. Indeed, this has taken a geopolitical bent as even some leading members of the administration point out that our economy is coming increasingly under the control of foreign actors, with strings being pulled by shadowmen far from the view of Taiyuan.\n\nProponents of these changes dismiss these claims, arguing that a motley group of radicals are grasping at invisible straws to try and stop what is likely an inevitable change. Shanxi has seen a tremendous increase in wealth and efficiency since these companies have come in, and trained intellectuals, businessmen and technicians have followed them. To them, the greater investment is nothing but a win-win, a case of aligned interests. Shanxi grows wealthier, and the rest of China does as well."

While many applauded this move, opinions have soured in some sectors. Although nominally sponsored by figures in the Rural Reconstruction Movement, it appears that other interest groups have had considerable influence on what was expected to be an uncontroversial bill. The provisions, while still being studied in further depth by the government, appear to broadly favour the gentry and other large landowners at the expense of small farmers and tenants.\n\nNaturally, this has attracted considerable backlash - inflaming tensions already brought to the forefront by our Ten Year agenda. Various rural agitators have been trying to stir up the peasants to protest, claiming this recent initiative is proof that the central government has no interest in genuinely helping the people. Experts however have begun to defend receiving this aid, noting that Shanxi needs modern tools, training and above all funding that this initiative will provide. And of course, the gentry have been won over, demanding that the Governor allow this aid to go through to lessen the damage Black Monday and several years of flooding have done to the province."

Although our propaganda machine was careful to make the most out of the various compliments Yen paid for our decades-long youth education initiatives, and minimise the critiques he made, he was right that although Shanxi has come a long way since 1911, plenty more has to be done.\n\nIt is said that he was pleased that our energised Ten Year Plan has included a renewed focus on education, though owing to the situation in Beijing he has declined to visit us again this year. However, it does appear that the National Assembly has approved a large grant to sponsor another push to teach all Shanxi children the basics of reading and writing. As a secondary effect, it has also prompted an increase in communication between Taiyuan University and other Chinese institutes.\n\nAccepting this grant however will not come without some strings attached of course, though virtually all leading authorities in education have pleaded with [ROOT.GetLeader] to do so for the sake of the children. A few reactionary members of the government have stubbornly attempted to dissuade the Governor from this course of action, arguing that the urban intelligentsia are infested with socialists, radicals, and fools.

And yet, perhaps as a sign of the changing times in China, we have received an offer from the staff at Baoding Military academy to send a training mission over to Taiyuan to enhance the quality of the provincial army. Along with the necessary staff, several train cars full of equipment will be provided as well.\n\nThis is certainly a massive step up from the quality of advice given to us by the various mercenaries we have hired or lessons learned from the \"green forest\". Learning the modern ways of war, the latest from Europe (or so they claim), would greatly enhance the quality of our soldiers.\n\nHowever, the high command (dominated by Guominjun and other ex-Zhili officers) is reluctant to work with their central government peers. Many stubbornly insist their experiences on the battlefield across the 1920s more than exceed anything the central army officers can provide, and that the province would be better off if our men are trained by Shanxi officers directly. Others snidely note that corruption is endemic in the army, and say the real reason for this resistance is fear of losing their jobs.\n\nIt should be further pointed out that nearly all the senior officers in command were themselves trained in Baoding, and therefore have strong feelings both ways about interacting with the modern Baoding staff."

The enlisted have been taught necessary skills such as logistics, communications, and combat, and have been shaped along Baoding lines.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] is said to be nothing short of impressed, congratulating this new division for their hard work and their evident (if not yet proven) quality. A question remains, however - shall this division be a temporary unit or a permanent one? There are merits to both suggestions - keeping it together will allow for an easier time preserving its quality and avoid excessively diluting its combat effectiveness. However, it will take considerably more time for the lessons learned by these men to disseminate across the army if they are kept together, and multiple advocates argue we are better off having the men of this division begin training units in other divisions across the province."

Still, compared to the revolutionary populism that makes up Feng Yuxiang's nationalist movement, and the numerous bridges Feng has burned in his wake, Yan is far more reliable by comparison.\n\nAs a result, it seems that in recent days the Central Government has mobilised some of their assets in the province to shore up support for Governor Yan in his struggle for power.

Still, if he had any regrets about leaving his post in Tsinghua, he didn't show it today as he met with [Root.GetLeader].\n\nWith the recent effort at improving education and creating a competitive scientific base to complement the growing technical sector, Ren was pleased to learn that he has been given a substantive grant from the government to build a new wing at Shanxi University and engage in the physics research he had been forced to put off since he returned home. Moreover, with the money he has received, he can finally hire trained staff and repair those outdated, fickle devices he had been forced to rely upon. As the chief scientific advisor to the government, it seems all of his life's tireless work since his impoverished upbringing has finally come to mean something."

He has been chosen to lead the similarly prestigious School of Village Education, a model academy within the province that aims to promote a modernised take on training farmers and farm managers.\n\nAlthough his prestige has waned considerably since his gold medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, his expertise it appears has only grown with decades of experience since the 1915 World Fair. His plans for the province are rather conventional - a series of irrigation, communication, and agronomic projects that will revitalise the agricultural industry. With tensions still high between the agitated peasant farmers and the powerful landlord clans, it is up to him to navigate the middle way forward."

He has already drawn up a series of proposals to extract the most he can out of Shanxi's underdeveloped agricultural sector (and others), working diligently to carry out his master's will.\n\nWith an aggressive series of modernisation and centralisation measures, his ambition is to maximise productivity and crack down on the unrest that permeates the province.

But not all laws can be enforced by gendarmes or a midnight visit by the secret police. And that's why Feng Sizhi has been recently elevated to Minister of the Interior.\n\nThe long-time Chief of the Shanxi People's Political Supervisorial Association, his responsibility often included audits and anti-corruption initiatives. In addition to expanding these efforts, he has also proposed the creation of an internally-focused Shanxi Provincial Intelligence Department independent of the Peace Preservation Bureau. Perhaps stemming from his initial background as an educator, he has also expressed interest in creating more pro-governmental newspapers to buttress the administration of [SHX.GetLeader].\n\nWhatever the case, with Feng Sizhi at the helm of the Interior Ministry, prospective revolutionaries will think twice before creating further instability."

Aside from the usual functions his department has in disseminating propaganda and creating a consistent ideological programme (usually in hindsight after policies are already implemented), his goal is the formation and expansion of a project known as the \"League of National Salvation through Sacrifice\", a spiritual successor to the Dare-to-Die Corps of the Xinhai revolution.

 shx_zhifeng.9.d: "[SHX.GetLeader]的代表们寒暄了几句，然后就摆出一副冷漠脸——这是种古老的谈判策略。然后，他们终于提出了详细提案，并坚称接受这份初稿必能使督理继续保持友好和忠诚。低级别的外交人员正在敲定细节，但山西提案的大致轮廓已经很明显了。\n\n[SHX_QIE_negotiation_offer_on_table]\n\n在扑克脸与觥筹交错之间，要读出这些使者的想法很困难，尤其是他们还得不断给太原打电报寻求主子的认可。谈判仍处于初期阶段，鉴于我们的影响力，我们或许可以迫使他们重新考虑条款；或者，在仔细阅读条款后，我们也可能认为应该完全接受，或者完全拒绝这些条款，而不是浪费更多政治资本来施压。选择权在我们手中。"

 shx_suiyuan_campaign.1.d: "Suiyuan is a province bordering the Shanxi clique to the Northwest, with relatively low population density and with great mineral resources. Only two sections of the Great Wall separate Shanxi from Suiyuan, and during the early days of the Warlord Era, Yan Xishan used the advance of various bandits from the province into Shanxi as a pretext to invade and occupy the region. Officially a special autonomous area under the Beiyang government, Suiyuan was also briefly occupied by advancing Guominjun troops under Feng Yuxiang based out of Shaanxi. Conflict naturally broke out among the two men as they competed for influence over both the Ordos and Ulanqab regions.\n\nThe ambitions of both men for the area, which has a melting pot of Hui, Han, and Mongolian residents, were cut short by the end of the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war. The Ma clique, rebelling against Feng Yuxiang and the Guominjun after the Northern Expedition, were rewarded with control over all of Suiyuan as part of the final settlement between the Shanxi clique (now a merger of the Yan clique and Feng's Guominjun) and the Central Government. Ma Fuxiang in particular was given the title of Chairman of the Tibetan and Mongol Affairs Commission, a reward for his treachery.\n\nWith the power of [SHX.GetNameDef] back on the rise, our interests in Suiyuan have not decreased. Threatened by the nationalists in [MON.GetNameDef], not to mention the mismanagement of Hui leadership in [XSM.GetNameDef], we must act quickly if we are to recover our treasured territory."

Although they have in the past sworn nominal allegiance to the Central Government in Beijing, they have in practice remained neutral in most conflicts embroiling Eastern/Han China. Nonetheless, they see themselves as Chinese and as the bulwark of Chinese authority over the increasingly rebellious Mongols and Tibetans.\n\nHaving successfully fended off their challengers in the Northwest War against a Buddhist alliance of rebellious states, they are nonetheless severely bloodied from their little adventure. This is at last our chance to get revenge for their stab in the back during the 1920s, and make a play to demand the return of Suiyuan to us. Or else."

They claim that our governance of the area was merely a temporary measure enforced by the Zhili following their victory in 1928, and that it should be promptly returned to its \"proper owners\".\n\nNaturally of course, this is a naked example of imperialism and the arrogance of [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].

By contrast, they note that they were the ones that saved Suiyuan from being overrun by Mongolian invaders.\n\nWe in Shanxi take great umbrage to this insult, however it may not necessarily be wise to escalate these matters. Although the Ma Clique has been significantly weakened by the fighting in the Northwest war, the terrain is notoriously difficult to fight on and it will require substantial resources to maintain a campaign that far away from our supply bases. Moreover, the Hui in the area are expected to remain loyal to their Ma overlords and the Mongolians there will likely remain neutral. The question remains whether or not the Ma have called our bluff, or if we have the wherewithal to back our words with lead."

A melting pot of Hui, Han, and Mongol residents, what is likely the true source of contention is its valuable soil suitable for grazing and agriculture as well as major iron deposits.\n\nThe [SHX.GetName] have made their case that they were unjustly stripped of their land in 1928 by their unfair association with the Guominjun as well as the fact that the mismanagement by the Ma clique was a major part in instigating the Northwest war. According to them, the only ones capable of protecting the area from future enemy advance is the comparatively wealthier and stronger [SHX.GetName]. They have also leaned (not so subtly) on our shared Han heritage and our recent rapprochement.\n\nThe Ma representatives, who have rushed to Beijing, protest that they ultimately did win the war for the Northwest, albeit at a great cost, and have been far more loyal to our government than [SHX.GetLeader]. In their words, [SHX.GetLeader] is an opportunist that is swooping in like a vulture to devour those that should be allies.\n\nSome say that we should simply stay out of this matter altogether. Both the Ma and Shanxi clique have been largely unreliable in the past, with the Ma clique siding with the Guominjun and largely staying neutral in contemporary Chinese affairs while the Shanxi clique have sided in the past with Fengtian and the Anhui cliques. Washing our hands of this matter will likely lead to violence, but a violence that will keep both distracted from scheming against us."

To our tremendous disappointment, they feel that despite the prior treachery of [SHX.GetLeader], he makes for a far more useful ally in the near as well as long term. This is likely due to his ability to furnish a larger army as well as one equipped with artillery produced by Taiyuan Arsenal.\n\nWe are left then with really two choices. Either we yield and hand over Suiyuan or call the Central Government's (and by extension [SHX.GetLeader]'s) bluff. After all, we know the terrain, the Hui are likely to be loyal to us and the Mongols neutral in this inter-Chinese affair, and Beijing has bigger problems to deal with. If we hold our ground, take advantage of our fighting experience and Shanxi's lack of it, as well as Beijing's indifference, we might just be able to keep our land."
 shx_suiyuan_campaign.7.d.2: "The emissaries of [QIE.GetNameDef] have heard Shanxi's request to return Suiyuan to their control and have decided to side with their new allies in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], citing our continued disloyalty and inability to defend the valuable province. They have instead decided that [SHX.GetLeader] is the rightful ruler of the province and is to be appointed Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi and Suiyuan effective immediately. Unofficially, they have decided that Shanxi makes for a more valuable ally, seeing our aloofness to Eastern Chinese affairs as no longer a benefit but a detriment to their plans for national unification.\n\nGiven the vast mismatch in strength between us and the Central Government, it appears that we have little choice but to comply with their cruel demand, stripping away a vital province filled with loyal Hui minorities. Especially after our critical service in defending the region from Mongol invasion, one would think that our loyalty to China would be proven.\n\nAppealing this decision is unlikely to yield us significant results without major concessions to our own autonomy, but it is an option. Of course, there is always the emotionally tempting but practically dangerous option of defying Beijing - taking advantage of our knowledge of the terrain and the inexperience of Shanxi Provincial Army troops to win a major upset."

They have also assured us that they will act much closer aligned to us, a tacit quid-pro-quo of reduced autonomy should we allow them to retain their beloved \"core\" territories.\n\nThis would mean, however, effectively reversing course and will be seen as a betrayal by [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].

They have further cautioned us against taking any aggressive action to destabilise Suiyuan, and when we attempted to appeal they had the nerve to chastise us for attempting to humiliate the Ma clans after their heroic defence of the Chinese nation against Russian funded separatists.\n\nGiven the circumstances and the fact that we are locked into an alliance at the moment, it does not seem like there is much we can do but grit our teeth for now and accept it."

It appears that we have irrevocably damaged ties between ourselves as the Ma, who have long been effectively neutral in Chinese affairs.\n\nSomething needs to be done, the question is what? Given the rugged terrain of the northwest, and the Ma's reputation for being ruthless, vicious horsemen familiar with the land, sending an expedition is dangerous and expensive. It will draw Central Army troops away from where they are needed guarding the valuable regions of China's east.\n\nThe one alternative, as some of our councillors note is to rely on the man whose fault this is.

Given the lack of coordination between Beijing and our own Provincial Army, it can be assumed that whatever spoils we gain from this upcoming campaign will be proportionate to what we can secure for ourselves.

Unfortunately for us, we are that card. Seeing their bluff called, in order to avoid losing face they have decided to sic us onto the rebellious Hui warlords - demanding [SHX.GetLeader] send his provincial armies to bring the Ma back into the fold.\n\nAs a double victory for them, sending us into what may potentially be a draining morass against what is expected to be a ferocious enemy will likely bog down our forces for a considerable amount of time.

Either we stand down and allow the Ma to get away with their unjust occupation of Suiyuan. Or we chase them into the setting sun and risk a potentially draining conflict for both sides, one that will keep us distracted from participating in Eastern Chinese affairs.

On the other hand, if we truly want to claim the mantle of defender then perhaps we should work to retake all former Hui territories - including Qinghai as well. This would almost guarantee war with Tibet, but then again they were likely to fight us anyway."

Egged on by agitators working out of [SHX.GetNameDef], Hui militias and raiders have been causing all sorts of trouble in the area, no doubt in preparation for a wider conflict. Already the area has effectively become lawless, with the border increasingly in flux and economic activity disrupted.

The collapse of the Xibei San Ma clique and the influx of those fleeing the advances of Mongol and Tibetan forces has already brought considerable disorder in the area. Many are suspicious of outsiders, even the forces from [SHX.GetNameDef] that are supposed to be there to help \"pacify\" the region.\n\nIt certainly does not help then, that raiders from enemy powers have made their way between border posts in Gansu, further stoking up tensions in the area and causing suspicion about the ability for outside forces to help the natives. Escalating violence along the frontier has threatened Chinese authority in the area, and the border grows ever porous. It is clear that in the end this conflict will be decided by war. As the cycle of harm and retaliation continues, the meek and powerless can do little but suffer what they will for the ambitions of uncaring warlords."

With our resources limited and a western expedition deemed unwise for now, it appeared at the time that we had little choice but to simply wait for a better opportunity.\n\nThat chance has come today, though perhaps not in the form we necessarily would like. The incorrigible [SHX.GetLeader], in his ever-growing ambitions, has decided to amass his army in hopes of restoring Chinese control over contested regions in Xibei and bringing Mongolia to heel. Perhaps Tibet too. Although we know that his real motivation in all of this is to recover Suiyuan, he has nonetheless created some degree of public enthusiasm across the Chinese world for his crusade, and he has openly asked for our \"blessing\" for his endeavour.\n\nThis might actually work in our favour long term - dealing with a petty tyrant like [SHX.GetLeader], who is Han Chinese, is likely to be easier than one who sees us as a foreign occupier. And, at the very least, hopefully this conflict will keep the armies of [SHX.GetNameDef] busy for a year or so - and out of our hair."

And that is the nicest response we have received. In private, they hiss that they do not trust us to succeed in our expedition, and warn that doing so will only embarrass them further. Moreover, they fear a war with Mongolia will draw the attention of other threats, and insist that we fall on our swords and lose face for the sake of their government.\n\nThis absolute betrayal of the Chinese nation only further underscores how undeserving [QIE.GetLeader] is of his mantle of leadership, and emboldens [SHX.GetLeader] to one day make his own play for that duty.

In a ceremony today, they have named [SHX.GetLeader] the \"Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi and Suiyuan\", implicitly supporting our claim over the Northwest.\n\nStill, in private they have been quick to warn us of the dangers ahead. Should we fail, we will not only disgrace ourselves and our army, but also the Chinese people as a whole. China, in their words, cannot afford to be humiliated twice by secessionist powers, and we will not be easily forgiven should we come home defeated. Not by them, nor the people we claim to serve."

Many itch for a chance to redeem themselves against their old foes, and bringing them into our fold will give as an advantage in the coming war.\n\nOur work with Hui elders has given us an inroad in enlisting the support of their sons and grandsons.

Others will be returned to their original owners, seeing little purpose in continued occupation. It will take time for prisoners to finish being released and for any stragglers believed missing in action to return to their posts. In the meanwhile, the people in the area are mourning the dead and processing the news of the war. With any luck, this will be the final conflict that embroils the region."

An influx of Chinese settlers in the area has also caused outrage as [SHX.GetLeader] has openly mulled stripping the princes of what limited powers they possess on the grounds they cannot govern the Chinese effectively.\n\nBanding together with what remaining weapons we have not been able to confiscate and threatening further disruptions in our efforts to extract valuable iron ore for our steel foundries and well as crops to feed our growing economy, the Mongols have formed what they call the \"Inner Mongolian Autonomous Political Council\" and have tried (with little success) at courting outside support. It might be better to come to an accord with these princes quickly, lest the lower classes begin to shift support to them.

However, the fertile soil has attracted considerable settlement by Chinese groups, who have over the centuries established a sedentary society in the region.\n\nWith our recent acquisition over the region, we have also gained the headache of managing relations between conflicting groups. Unfortunately, the increased settlement (which has been encouraged by our policies and protected by our garrisons) has greatly reduced the grazing area that Mongol clans depend on to feed their animals. Feeling greatly mistreated and seeing their lands ploughed over almost overnight, many have begun to rebel and have launched raids on Chinese farms.\n\nWhile reinforcing our fortifications is an option, the entire region is threatened by continued instability.\n\nA group of nominally aligned Mongol princes called the \"Inner Mongolian Autonomous Political Council\" have offered to mediate the matter, creating a compromise that will give the Mongols the autonomy they seek while keeping the peace.

Calling for the revival of the Chinese Village through an ambitious series of agricultural, educational, and other reforms, their agenda is not  dissimilar from the Ten Year Plan conducted in Shanxi. Although not a formal party, they make up a powerful but pliant interest group compatible with the more progressive reforms of [SHX.GetLeader].\n\nMany former members of the Harmony Association, the civilian wing of Wu Peifu's Zhili clique, as well as other former legislators have coalesced around the \"Democratic Constitutionalist Party\", the successor to the big tent Progressive Party formed in 1913. They have selected Hu Shih as their leader, and he is expected to command a large bloc of northern moderates ostensibly united by the ideals of the New Culture Movement.\n\nA smaller group of legislators have rallied under the so-called \"Recovery Party\", a merger of the moribund Recovery League (the successors of the Anhui clique) and the Communications Clique. Led by Liang Shiyi, they consist primarily of those who had previously served in the Fengtian government but have since broken with the traitor Zhang Zuolin. They have found their niche courting industrial interests and supporting fiscal stability.\n\nWinning some friends in the northern establishment is critical for the continued good function of our republic.

It was there that various anti-monarchist and revolutionary groups were born such as the National Protection Alliance against Yuan Shikai, the Federalist movement led by Chen Jiongming, and the Kuomintang of Sun Yat-sen. Behind them were dozens of smaller factions, including many genuine believers in democracy and societal reform. It is these men who now take the lead, emerging from the ashes of the defeated.\n\nHoping to navigate the waters of this new government and tread a \"third path\" between socialist or nationalist extremism and military rule, a so-called \"Chinese Democratic League\" has been formed under the leadership of Zhang Junmai (Carsun Chung). A political idealist, scholar, and social democrat, his ability to rally this coalition of various smaller parties and interest groups is more of a product of their inability to achieve prominence otherwise rather than his political savvy.\n\nStill, they have achieved good international press because of their democratic leanings and support for principles such as constitutionalism, separation of powers, and human rights. He has also absorbed much of the remaining federalists under his banner, giving his alliance a particular niche in elections, though the CDL remains unwieldy and big tented with utopian but divided goals. Its fate as a genuine vessel of republicanism or just a front for southern political machines will likely depend on early and effective patronage under someone far more realistic than Zhang."

The very real possibility that [SHX.GetLeader] would favour them in a way that their prior patrons have not has encouraged them to double down on their beliefs, energetically courting the new President and his advisors. Having come to power with little institutional support or a dedicated political party, the YCP hopes to fill that void in [SHX.GetLeader]'s regime, acting as his primary vehicle for political control.\n\nThe Young China Party's plans for the recently united China is nothing short of thorough. Taking inspiration from foreign ideologies and with plenty of time to ponder, the intellectual wing of the YCP has adopted a darwinian mentality when it comes to the realm of nations. If China is to survive into the second half of this century, it must begin a programme of mass modernisation and industrialisation. Their platform is fiercely nationalistic and anti-imperialist, seeking aggressive measures in securing the end of concessions or foreign influence. This extends to cracking down on secessionist or regionalist movements and their promotion of Han chauvinism has worried many who fear further instability. But perhaps most worrisome for this fledging republic is their desire for national unity at any cost, demanding mass ideological indoctrination and the effective implementation of a one-party state, built around what will effectively become a cult of personality behind [SHX.GetLeader].\n\nIn sum, they have clearly thought up a comprehensive slate of programmes for China, which when implemented might very well be monumental in scope. But left unsaid is their expectation of exclusivity, and in any case other parties we have allied will likely distance themselves should we align with the YCP. But unlike the more moderate parties they offer a degree of ideological unity, and might [SHX.GetLeader] be tempted by such absolute power?"

The party champions Chinese nationalism and adheres to Sun's Three Principles of the People (Minzu, Minquan, and Minsheng - Nationalism, People's Governance, and the People's Livelihood, respectively).\n\nThe Nationalist Party attempted to overthrow the Zhili Clique in 1925 with the Northern Expedition based out of Guangzhou. Their failure in that expedition forced the Chinese Kuomintang to flee overseas or participate in the Jiangsu-Fujian Insurgent Zone. Despite being known as a \"big tent party,\" the Kuomintang has taken a decidedly leftist direction with many of its leaders professing to the ideas of socialism and Chinese nationalism.\n\nAlthough their latest effort at revolution has ended in failure, some of their party have nonetheless begun organising anew in our republic. Although Yan is not fond of socialists, their ideas of state capitalism and aggressive industrialisation are tempting, not to mention their mass appeal. On the other hand however, any agreement we sign with them will likely force other parties we have previously allied with to distance themselves from us and put us ever closer to the \"anarchy\" that Yan Xishan has spent his life trying to fight.

The political system in many areas remains dominated by ex-warlords and their associates, and nepotism remains commonplace.

To aid those people who had suffered from the war, and to prevent anyone's losing his home.\n2. To order the national finances and tax structure, and to eliminate oppressive taxation.\n3. To register the population as a means of preventing banditry.\n4. To maintain order among regional patrol forces until they could be reorganised.\n5.

Indeed, pursuant of objective two, Feng has ordered the confiscation of much of the wealth of former opposing warlords - particuarly those who have fled abroad. Although many assets have been stashed in foreign banks, their mansions have been taken and a great deal of treasure has been reported as seized.

 shx_endgame.15.d: "The first months of Yan Xishan's administration across a united China has sparked a flurry of activity in the national capital. A surge of bureaucrats and others hoping to seek new positions in the government has brought large numbers of people to [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], perhaps most evident by the constructions of dozens of new mansions near the Presidential Palace.\n\nYan Xishan's own family has begun moving in. His wife, Xu Zhuqing was unable to bear children so Yan's parents instructed him to take on a concubine Xu Lansen (a common practice in 1903). To avoid conflict, both women were required to be considered sisters, and Xu Zhuqing was to be considered the mother of Xu Lansen's five children.\n\nYan's household has suffered considerable tragedy over the last few years during his struggle to liberate China. Poor medical conditions and plague meant his first and third sons (Yan Zhigong and Zhixin) died in infancy in the early warlord era. Both of his wives have also since died, leaving Yan's dedicated cousin Yan Huiqing to take care of his daily needs (on top of being Chairwoman of the Women's Association).\n\nWith his children born relatively late (Yan was in his forties), he arranged marriages for them at an early age. Yan Zhikuan (the second eldest born in 1919) has died of severe epilepsy, just after having two children. Yan's other two sons, Yan Zhimin (born 1926) and Yan Zhihui (born 1927) are extremely young, posing some concern for Yan's future succession.\n\nRestless despite his hectic schedule and often stressed about not only matters of succession but the general future of his young republic, Yan Xishan frequently frets about the progress of his reforms. He fears the anarchy that will overtake the nation without his wisdom. In his few quiet moments, he dreams of writing down his many thoughts, perhaps when he isn't so busy. Titles like \"The Error of Syndicalism\", \"The Impending World Crisis\", \"Peace or World War\", \"The Road to Cosmopolitanism\", \"How to Impede War and Establish the Foundation of World Peace\".

Over a generation after the end of the Opium Wars, large segments of the population find themselves addicted to the vice and its elimination has become a national rally cry. Creating meaningful solutions however has always been a challenge, often sabotaged by the very people who claim to want to end it."
 shx_endgame.16.d.yan: "$shx_endgame.16.intro$\n\nYan Xishan knows all too well how difficult it is to eliminate opium even on a small scale. In 1916 nearly 10% of Shanxi were addicts, causing severe poverty and moral decay. The Society for the Suppression of Opium Smoking was tasked in rooting out the problem, arresting dealers and seizing cargo to price out addicts.\n\nYan brutally fined them, humiliating, and imprisoned addicts, often in work camps where they died of withdrawl. But unable to sustain the prison population and drawing public ire, he switched tracks to rehabilitation - using sanitariums and gradual weaning of drugs instead.\n\nInitially successful in reducing addiction by 80%, the soaring prices meant enterprising opium merchants found a lucrative market in Shanxi, sometimes escorted by warlord troops of neighbouring provinces. In the end, Yan caved and tried creating a government monopoly on the drug, ostensibly selling \"medicine\" to cure addiction. Magistrates were given hundreds of kilos of such \"medicine\" to sell (losing their jobs if they failed), though ultimately Yan was outcompeted even in this regard by an influx of foreign \"pills of immortality\" (a mix of heroin and morphine)."
 shx_endgame.16.d.feng: "$shx_endgame.16.intro$\n\nFor Feng Yuxiang, this problem is a very personal one - his impoverished parents were both addicts and wasted away what little money they had on the drug. Feng has made it is quest to seek its elimination, and like many see opium as emblematic of China's descent into moral (and practical) corruption. Fighting addiction also takes a nationalistic bent: Questions 18 and 19 of the Guominjun catechism blames the start of foreign \"browbeating\" on the English's \"forcible introduction of opium into the country\".\n\nIn his career, Feng Yuxiang has often ordered the total ban of opium, arresting dealers and establishing expert-run sanitariums as a progressive means of curing the problem.\n\nStill, this has not always been succcessful, thorough or even implemented for long. The wealthy were given lax treatment, with the focus primarily being on giving poor addicts a trade. Feng often found himself tapping into the lucrative taxation of the opium trade, and like other warlords sometimes the Opium Suppression Bureaus were used to help raise money for the cash-strapped army."

In it, he has written down three principles consistent with such a system:\n\n1. The fruit of one's labour should be wholly given to the labourer for his contribution. It should not be exploited by any method or system.\n2. The labourer should be provided with ample opportunity for employment, without it he will have no chance of sustaining his livelihood.\n3. The effectiveness of labour must be increased so his standard of living may increase as well.\n\nUndoubtably proud of his insight, an outgrowth of his prior work in Shanxi province and his Philosophy of China, he has boasted that he has found the middle solution between socialist radicalism and capitalist exploitation. He has gone so far as to order his pamphlets published in foreign languages, with the hopes of disseminating it abroad to strengthen his image as an enlightened ruler."

Exposed however to the open air, they have been partially damaged by industrial pollution from the Ten Year Plan.\n\nSince the beginning, the Yungang Grottoes were built and sponsored by the Imperial court, with successive dynasties working at various points to preserve them. With China under a new master in a new age, it seems the modern rulers are little different in their appreciation of such an awe-inspiring work of art."

 SHX_strict_neutrality_desc: "Surrounded by high mountains and tense neighbours, the leadership of Shanxi has fallen into a deep political and diplomatic isolationism. This perpetual siege mentality has ironically given Shanxi's leadership some peace of mind from Zhili encroachment, but their regionalist messaging has left their people apathetic to any foreign interventionism. If Yan and Feng have any dreams of leaving Taiyuan, then a consistent vision is necessary to rally the people."

Once again looking outwards, it is clear that the [SHX.GetRulingParty] still dreams of uniting China and sharing its vision with others. The people too, from the gentry to the intellectuals to even the humble laobaixing appear to share this growing sentiment. Many obstacles remain and Shanxi would be an underdog in any conflict, but maybe Shanxi won't be isolated forever."

 SHX_Ten_Year_Plan_begins_desc: "Change is in the air in Shanxi. Although the laobaixing don't know or don't care about the petty politics between Shanxi's strongmen, even they can feel it too. Village headsmen working instead of gambling at night, activists and propagandists buzzing around at greater frequencies, and magistrates from Taiyuan actually worrying about generating genuine numbers. Even outsiders have taken notice - investors from Beijing and observers from outside the country have made conspicuous visits, taking note of the goings about in Shanxi. Although Shanxi has been undergoing a Ten Year plan since 1936, recently it has taken a new urgency. Change will come this time. Even if it's not clear yet to whose benefit. An even if tremendous sacrifice will be needed. But the people are, ever cautiously, hopeful."
 SHX_order_of_the_vigilant_lion_idea: "醒狮勋章"
 SHX_order_of_the_vigilant_lion_idea_desc: "The Order of the Vigilant Lion was originally established in Shanxi during the early days of the warlord era as a means of rewarding villagers and villages who successfully killed various desperados. At the time, brigands frequently roamed about - looting at random and extorting from the masses huddling behind the walls of town citadels. The mountainous terrain of Shanxi often worked against law enforcement, as these outlaws frequently retreated into the mountainside between raids. The Order was part of the Shanxi clique's early and defining successes in consolidating control of the province, and now with the increase of political instability from agitators both within and without it becomes necessary to reorient our state security policy towards targetting... \"bandits\". The heightened paranoia in the province has not done our political stability any favours, but few can doubt the success we have had in counterintelligence efforts."
 SHX_strengthen_local_councils: "强化地方议会"
 SHX_strengthen_local_councils_desc: "As part of Shaanxi's efforts to move forward in harnessing public support for our agenda, it becomes necessary to empower local councils in various villages in towns. These efforts have been modelled after Feng Yuxiang's Rural Training institutes, which sought to teach villages under his control the fundamentals needed for self-governing. This of course has led to plenty of head-butting with members of the gentry, who traditionally hold power in these councils, as well as that of the provincial bureaucracy - which has sought to curtail the power of village councils. An outsider should also be wary of overestimating this effort in bringing out a Western-style, liberal democracy - although no doubt with sincere motivations behind them, these programmes are closer in nature to Sun Yat-sen's political tutelage and it will be a long time before a genuine democracy is established in China."

 SHX_consolidate_bureaucracy_desc: "As part of Shanxi's efforts to move forward in harnessing the province's resources for our agenda, it becomes necessary to increase the power and scope of our provincial bureaucracies in reigning in other power structures in our province. Centred around the Institute of Political Administration established by Yan Xishan, magistrates of Shanxi's hundreds of districts are being trained with the necessary skills to oversee the various villages and towns. This has led to pushback, naturally, by members of the gentry who tend to dominate the village councils these magistrates tread over, as well as various particularist peasant groups who resent the expanded influence of officers from Taiyuan. An outsider however should be wary of overestimating this effort in bringing about a Western-style, modern bureaucracy - although no doubt with sincere motivations behind them, this effort still struggles with corruption and entrenched political interests even as it tries to expand the reach of Yan Xishan's paternalistic dictatorship."
 SHX_a_higher_purpose_idea: "重整本地政治"
 SHX_a_higher_purpose_idea_desc: "Shanxi is at a crossroads of sorts, where the collective will of the people across the land the Shanxi clique rules must soon make a decision about what type of future they will pursue. Yan Xishan represents an authoritarian, Confucian-influence style of leadership - a sort of continuation of several decades of stability-focused rule. Conservative in thought but willing to embrace modernity, the old governor promises to restore the balance and harmony that was stolen from China. Feng Yuxiang also claims to want to bring China to the place it should be, however, his vision is rather different. A revolutionary and a soldier by trade, his view for the future involves a revolutionary, nationalistic sort of leadership that will bring about a social and political revolution to the nation. To him, he is restoring the democracy and reform that was similarly stolen from China after Xinhai. The decision is difficult, and the people are divided. But one thing is certain - Shanxi will go forward together!"

One of the poorest provinces in China, Yan's leadership has brought about a peace that has promoted some limited prosperity. However, their economy remains heavily dominated by Beijing's influence from the outside and the suspicious gentry from within. Yan has desperately tried to reverse the trade deficit and soaring inflation in the 1920s, but his various endeavours litter the countryside half-finished at best. For all of their claims of being a \"Model Province\", the reality is more sordid. Plenty feel most of the projects the \"Model Governor\" embarks on are merely pretentious shows of \"progress\" for the consumption of outsiders rather than a sincere effort at reform. Only time will tell if they are right."
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy1: "山区经济崩溃"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy1_desc: "Mountainous, agrarian and poor - and now ten times worse - Shanxi's economy is in free-fall dealing with the aftershocks of Black Monday. While the actual impact of the global recession has been mostly muted in China as a whole, in many ways the recession falling over the nation has destabilised Shanxi's fragile industrial economy. Its cottage industries, already years in decline as a product of the meandering Ten Year Plan, are teetering on the verge of collapse: candlemakers, copper utensil crafters, pawnshops. Shanxi's limited industrial base is also beginning to fail, with textile mills, match factories, and Shanxi's only distillery all in the red, it is estimated that nine tenths of Taiyuan's businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy. Unemployment is soaring, with nearly a third of the population out of work. Students have begun protesting that their only prospect is to \"graduate and join the jobless\" while the ranks of people entering the poorhouse are expected to double. Worse yet, the social impacts of this crash are quickly being felt as the chill of crime falls over the city, propelled by the people's desperation. Something needs to be done soon - a strong leader must emerge or at least fingers need to be pointed."
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy2: "国家资本主义萌芽"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy2_desc: "Shanxi's diarchy have long prided themselves as being \"state capitalists\" inspired at least in part by the modernisation efforts done in Japan as well as interventionist rhetoric by various politicians in the United States. This effort has only increased as of late, with a recent flurry of subsidies to prop up light industries in Taiyuan such as flour mills, cigarette factories, and paper mills. These smaller factories and workshops teach soldiers and the unemployed how to make soap, candles and clothing - as part of a broader network that underwrites Shanxi's heavier industry and helps keep the province somewhat self-sufficient. Still, there are the usual problems - high quotas and persistent corruption mean that the undertrained, underpaid factory managers tend to cut corners and costs. The inferior quality products often mean that Shanxi struggles to compete with products even made in China, at a time when many Western companies feel pressured to dump as much of their surplus production into the developing world to prop up their own economies during the global depression."
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng: "自足国家资本主义"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng_desc: "Governor Yan has frequently been quoted as saying \"proper organisation and administration is just as important as good machinery\". And with the recent direction governmental authorities have gone, a greater emphasis has been made on promoting a \"scientific management\" of industry. Indeed, while long a passion project of Governor Yan, who theorises that China has missed out on the West's \"Second Industrial Revolution\" of proper industrial management while barely embracing the first Industrial Revolution, this effort towards efficiency has also been taken up by many of Feng's supporters. To supplement the centralised control by provincial bureaucracy on the economy, Shanxi has been training a parallel hierarchy of technical experts to specialise in carrying out this Ten Year plan. Of course, with corruption still being a systematic problem and many administrators being appointed on the basis of nepotism, Shanxi still has a long way to go in this regard."
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng1: "自足山区经济"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng1_desc: "It seems that after considerable effort and internal discipline, Shanxi has at last hit a crescendo with their industrial efforts. The Society of National Salvation Through Production (zao-chan jiu-guo she), a recently formed quasi-governmental organisation, have begun to aggressively push Shanxi's merchants to seek suppliers from within the province rather than seek contracts abroad. While many similar efforts were ignored or reluctantly followed, Shanxi has seen an upsurge in popular approval for these measures and a new economy is beginning to come to fruition. Corruption has begun to recede thanks to greater oversight, while the managers and workers have grown more accustomed to their industrial jobs. Wages are rising, but the government has opted to take things one step further. In an effort to stabilise the currency (which has seen tremendous inflation), the more ambitious planners in Taiyuan have advocated for the use of production certificates backed by government-stocked food and commodities in lieu of traditional money. Needless to say, some are wary of these major changes but Shanxi's leadership continue their march towards economic reform."
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng2: "革命山西经济"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng2_desc: "\"No longer enslaved by our monetary system, we are free to use our enormous human resources to develop our immense material resources\" is the boast of Taiyuan. Once merely idle talk between Yan and Feng, a truly revolutionary economic system has emerged in Shanxi. Although critics frequently complained that these production certificates were merely empty promises seeking to further exploit the people, the government has continued its reforms by establishing in cities and even towns government-run producers as well as consumer cooperative organisations. Producers are required to sell to these cooperatives, bringing Shanxi's economy heavily under the control of Taiyuan. Taiyuan in turn has been hard at work setting prices, regulating output and squeezing out foreign competition - to some success despite persistent mistrust. Regardless of its efficacy, people are hungry for change and this new system has been the talk (and sometimes ridicule) of many outside of Shanxi. Still, Shanxi promises to liberate this country, and it is clear that this industry is the basis for their plans."
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan: "发展山区经济"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan_desc: "Shanxi has seen an influx of foreign capital, which has helped stabilise the economy and promote greater industrialisation centred around Taiyuan. Indeed, Shanxi proves to be quite suited for industry, with its easy access to coal and iron ore as well as a large labour pool. Old industries have been reorganised and thriving under new ownership, and new efforts at expanding paper mills, tanneries, and distilleries have created a large job market. To meet new demands a fire-resistant brick plant and cement plant are now under construction. There are many hurdles left in the way of course, and corruption remains a big issue, though it appears that Beijing's investors have not yet been cowed by this. Easy money has gone hand in hand with bribes and nepotism. While detrimental, for now, it appears to simply be a matter of doing business. Nonetheless, many of Shanxi's domestic businessmen complain from time to time about being exploited by speculators with a more sophisticated grasp of economic conditions - particularly encouraging them to overproduce on goods."
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan1: "山区经济重振"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan1_desc: "Shanxi's economic boom has been nothing short of awe-inspiring, with production shooting through the roof and the quality of products made in Shanxi vastly improving. Bribes and nepotism have been mostly checked, with Shanxi's traditional banking clans growing more open to alliances with outside investors. The vast amounts of wealth flowing in and out of the province have smoothened over prior concerns, and Shanxi's capitalists are thinking long-term nowadays rather than scrounging for a quick cash grab. Urbanisation has been on the upswing, with people coming from across the province and even outside of it to seek jobs in Shanxi's factories. No doubt, much of the success of Shanxi's State Capitalism can be attributed to the partnership between Shanxi's government, its growing merchant class and foreign capitalists, but some wonder if things should be reigned in before the excesses grow too much. After all, when this plan was first initiated - was it not simply a temporary measure before liberation? Many wonder now if Shanxi will grow too decadent in its prosperity."
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan2: "山西经济重生"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan2_desc: "The Shanxi economic miracle will likely be something to be recorded in history books, something for others in China and elsewhere to emulate. With the right mixture of deregulation, while maintaining a collaborative approach to capital, state and labour, Shanxi's economic reforms have been nothing short of a glowing success. The opulence experienced by the elite of Shanxi has not been matched in the region since the days of the Piaohao, as the quality and scope of production in Shanxi have finally reached a point where Taiyuan's industries can compete for outside contracts. Not all industries survived, of course, there had to be some pruning done by both the free market and government authorities, but several - namely wool, matches, industrial alcohol, paper and bricks - have become a staple export of this province. There remain concerns of course, about the state of the people, the quality of Shanxi's rapidly built housing, and the new business culture setting into Shanxi's financial class. But Shanxi's economy has developed to the point that it may possibly be a contender once more for leadership of north China. The question is whether or not Shanxi will take that chance."

The Governor especially hopes to stabilise the previously ballooning provincial inflation."
 SHX_agriculture_reform: "贫困的农村"
 SHX_agriculture_reform_desc: "One of Shanxi's most prominent features is its highly stratified, backwards agricultural sector - a problem that has vexed policymakers (or at least the ones who care enough to pay attention) for decades. Due to Shanxi's mountainous terrain, very little of Shanxi's land is arable. Much of the fertile regions are concentrated near alluvial deposits in valleys neighbouring rivers. Central Shanxi in particular holds the Taiyuan basin, the heart of provincial power, which also hosts much of the extremely unpopular and exploitative tenantry system that places both beasts and men under a heavy yoke. Even in areas where tenantry is uncommon and most farmers own the land they till, the years of drought, a lack of modern technology, poor water control methods, governmental corruption and years of neglect have built up years of resentment that threaten to translate to revolutionary fever.\n\nThe human cost aside, Shanxi's agricultural sector is in many ways primitive and unprofitable to the detriment of the overall economy. Shanxi spends considerable amounts of specie annually to import food, worsening the trade deficit, despite agricultural pay being worse than in places such as India and the Philippines. Well over half (upwards of three quarters) live in absolute destitution, while the political scene is dominated by a rural gentry perceived as callous and uncaring. What resources are generated by Shanxi's farms and mills are rarely reinvested back into the economy, often squandered on frivolous expenses such as weddings while Shanxi's productivity slides further and further behind even other poor parts of China. Prior attempts by the provincial governments at uplifting the region have been largely unsuccessful and the Ten Year Plan (even when being implemented) largely neglects the farmers. But as the farmers toil under the hot sun, disillusionment threatens to turn to rage, and rage into action. It is clear that something must be done - and soon."
 SHX_agriculture_reform1: "承诺土地改革"
 SHX_agriculture_reform1_desc: "When the Xinhai revolution broke out nearly two decades ago, many hoped that the conditions in the countryside would finally change. Yan Xishan took charge of Shanxi along with other revolutionaries, and in his quest to revitalise the province placed a heavy emphasis on building up the agricultural economy. And yet, well over a decade later, Shanxi has little to show for it. Even as the province's authorities promise to invest in agriculture as much as they are in industry, promise to educate the farmers in modern techniques, and promise to improve the conditions of the people - all the people can hear is just that: empty words. Attempts at reforms to the common farmer simply means higher taxes and further infighting between the gentry and the state over the share of the agricultural surplus, with only a trickle falling down to the overworked and overburdened Laobaixing. It is no surprise that they are disappointed - litigation remains a powerful tool in the arsenal of the wealthy to keep the poor down, the government is frequently cowed by the demands of the gentry in rural matters, and even the nominally independent farmers are easy prey for usury by wealthy moneylenders.\n\nShanxi's leadership talk a big game about the future of the province, but it will require far more than just talk to accomplish anything of note. The original Ten Year Plan largely ignores the needs of Shanxi's agricultural sector in favour of heavy industrialisation, but it is also evident that Shanxi will need to address the situation in the countryside soon."

This has not been without considerable difficulty, as Shanxi's traditional powerbrokers in the gentry have taken a conservative stance - threatening to block progress. Many suspect the process as being hijacked by socialists or by a power-hungry Governor seeking to expand his influence at the expense of others, even as he tries to reassure them that this is the only way to avoid large-scale unrest. Of particular note is the emergence of the so-called \"Justice Force\" which has been assembled out of previous Village Inspection Committee leaders to help tackle rural corruption and further implement the Ten Year Plan. Their efforts, though sincere, frequently run into difficulties as Shanxi tries to toe the middle line between revolution and reaction but progress is being made in making a more equitable countryside."

Many reject assurances that these measures are to be limited in scope and are being done in the name of fairness - contending instead that they are an effort by an avaricious, power-crazed socialist cabal of thugs. Indeed, Shanxi has been toeing a fine line in keeping up the heat on the gentry to reform while avoiding inflaming tensions to the point that the entire countryside is set ablaze. The increased presence of militias (government, gentry-funded and peasant-organised) seems to confirm the suspicions of many that Shanxi is teetering on the verge of social collapse - but few doubt that the populist measures embarked on by the government have been popular. The question of the day however is whether or not the ultimate product will be the more egalitarian system they seek or another costly failure in Shanxi's campaign for progress."
 SHX_agriculture_reform_Yan1: "儒家农耕理想"
 SHX_agriculture_reform_Yan1_desc: "Yan Xishan and his circle have frequently looked to Confucian principles for inspiration in their governing practices, holding in particular esteem Confucian principles of harmony, authority and moderation. The fear of disorder and revolution has frequently entered the language of Shanxi governmental agents, as they hope to promote a more balanced, virtuous system. This appears to be the case for Shanxi's recent endeavours at improving the agricultural situation in the province, where provincial leaders have implemented a battery of reforms. These include suppressing the use of litigation as a means of coercion, implementing rent caps, redistributing some properties, and providing greater government oversight into the conduct of the gentry and the local governments they control. Further efforts appear to have been made in terms of material investments in the countryside, which have helped make Shanxi more productive and improved the quality of life for the people in it. The Governor in particular has gone further in building a culture of noblesse oblige, fostering an image that he is a Junzi - the epitome of Confucian virtue. History and time will tell whether or not this is merely propaganda, but even his critics will agree that Shanxi's peasants and even the gentry to an extent are far better off than they were at the start of the Ten Year Plan."
 SHX_agriculture_reform_Feng1: "耕者有其田"
 SHX_agriculture_reform_Feng1_desc: "Feng Yuxiang and his circle have cited many prior thinkers, philosophers and reformers for the need to return the land away from the gentry (who have hoarded an unfair portion) back to the simple men who till the soil every year. Some may say that this is a deceptively easy accomplishment, given that most farmers in Shanxi were not tenants even before the Ten Year Plan, but that belies the entrenched hierarchies and dogmatic opposition Shanxi's reformers fought through to get to where they are today. A wide-ranging series of reforms were carried out, including the mass redistribution of property to the peasants and the enforcement of laws upon the wealthy (who had traditionally enjoyed immunity to such things). This did cause chaos at first, and although the government downplays it - violence - but in the end, the forces of the humble farmer won out. Material investments were also made in the countryside to improve productivity and try to reduce the dependence of the peasants on predatory loans, though the disruption caused by these efforts means that in some areas things still lag behind. But few can doubt that the efforts made by Shanxi's leadership have truly inspired the people they sought to help, reversing a trend of cynicism and building a life-long base of public support. This has fostered an image that the Governor is a hero of the Laobaixing, a champion of the people that is willing to do what it takes to bring about a fairer system. And that type of reputation goes a long way, far beyond the borders of this humble province. History and time will tell whether or not this is merely propaganda, but even his critics will agree that Shanxi's peasants are far better off than they were at the start of the Ten Year Plan."
 SHX_paying_off_gentry: "回报乡绅"
 SHX_paying_off_gentry_desc: "The gentry have, after some pressure by the forces that be, agreed to back off from some of their demands. However, their compliance has not come cheap. They have demanded a rather extensive portion of the harvest, not to mention hard currency upfront to cease their activities against recent land reform measures. To avoid any further obstructions, we must work with them. However, it does show the extent to which the landed elite continue to maintain their hold over the province."
 SHX_agriculture_budget: "农业预算修正案"
 SHX_agriculture_budget_desc: "Wasteful spending and corruption are not uncommon in China, but in a province as poor as Shanxi they can be devastating. In their drive to reform agriculture, Shanxi's leadership has found that building meaningful reforms often mean sweeping away the dried-out husks of prior, failed reforms made as late as the early 1930s. Indeed, as the expenses mount and the finances remain tight, Shanxi's response to their soaring needs was to reassemble the entire agricultural budget. The Governor has assured the province that a clever mixture of raising taxes, cutting wasteful spending, and some foreign donations were the source of this new budget, though the specifics are a tight-kept secret. Most however are happy to ignore the clear efforts at evasion, which is common in Shanxi when it comes to money and budgets, and focus instead on the greater investments available for Shanxi's suffering peasants."
 SHX_fight_corruption_idea: "反贪腐十字军"
 SHX_fight_corruption_idea_desc: "Agricultural Corruption is, unfortunately, an all too common reality in Shanxi. Large agricultural clans utilise their wealth to take control of village leadership, moneylending practices like pawnshops and banks, the courts, and of course the economic system controlling the land itself. The Governor has mustered a raft of anti-corruption agencies to combat this, headed by the newly established Provincial Political Planning Committee and the Shanxi People's Political Supervisorial Association. The former oversees the over ten-thousand Village Inspection Committees and their Justice Force comrades who regularly audit villages and report upon their \"enthusiasm\" for the Governor's reforms. The latter agency publishes a weekly editorial known as \"Supervisorial Weekly\", publicly exposing the various wrongs members of the elite commit unto the commoners. The enthusiasm of this organisation has shocked many, with bold arrests and denouncements of thousands of officials, gentrymen, and other elites that have traditionally avoided scrutiny. Still, it has been a cause of concern as investigators continue to search up the chain - many fear who they may implicate next."

Forming groups such as the Youth Vanguard Corps and establishing the Shanxi Junior Middle School Boy's Army, young men in Shanxi are harshly trained starting in their teens in the ways of war."
 SHX_unfinished_education: "教育改革停滞"
 SHX_unfinished_education_desc: "Although much talk has been made about the quality of Yan Xishan's educational reforms, his praiseworthy efforts at modernising education in Shanxi have largely hit a wall since the 1920s. Major achievements such as the creation of widespread access to primary schooling, the promotion of literacy and the creation of a practical, Western-inspired educational system have suffered severe setbacks due to funding cuts and neglect as a consequence of the Zhili-Fengtian wars. The Guominjun, for all their campaigning about educating the public, have proven similarly delinquent on their promises - establishing schools but failing to follow through."
 SHX_unfinished_education1: "教育改革续行"
 SHX_unfinished_education1_desc: "The powers that be in Shanxi have, begrudgingly, begun a new effort to revitalise education in Shanxi. Despite both Feng and Yan having a tremendous prior interest in the subject, in part due to the ideological implications of shaping provincial youth, they have begun to significantly diverge in their approach to the issue. At the same time, the ripple effect of this resumed campaign to improve the people's knowledge has begun to receive pushback from conservatives, the gentry, academics and even the students themselves!"

These include topics such as engineering, geology, craftsmanship, mathematics, and some foreign language. Of course, plenty of criticisms remain, especially with regard to the distribution of scholarships and the actual competency of the faculty. But most acknowledge that progress is being made."

 SHX_unfinished_education_feng: "扩充入学途径"
 SHX_unfinished_education_feng_desc: "The Guominjun way has begun to win out as the Shanxi clique's implementation of educational reforms progress. With Shanxi's limited resources, Feng has opted to try and provide some degree of primary and secondary schooling to all students across the province, prioritising literacy and \"virtue\". Much of this has come at a cost and not without controversy - Feng's willingness to embrace heavy, some say extortionate, taxation and also conversions of Buddhist temples to schools has not won him many friends. But the Guominjun insist this effort will bring about a more equal and more productive society in the end."
 SHX_unfinished_education_feng1: "普及小学教育"
 SHX_unfinished_education_feng1_desc: "At the start of the decade, the implementation of universal primary schooling was spotty and unequal. No more than a third of all primary school-age children attended class. Many parents refused to send their children to school and many schools were not worth sending their children to. Through the efforts of the Guominjun, virtually all students in Shanxi attend at least primary schooling. Rural parents incorporate schooling into their work plans, the wealthy have largely accepted the higher taxation needed to fund local schools. An effort to revitalise higher education may have to wait, but they won't have to wait long."
 SHX_dual_armies: "一省两军"
 SHX_dual_armies_desc: "During the waning days of the Northern Expedition and the scramble for control of China's north, both Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang made unsuccessful plays for power in the region. After Wu Peifu established his dominance over the land with German aid and Zhang Zuolin carved out his domain in the Northeast with Japanese support, Yan and Feng were forced to settle for the scraps: exiled into a rugged backwater. Although both have approximately the same number of troops, Yan has been less successful in building a disciplined fighting force than Feng and his Guominjun. However, Yan controls the powerful Taiyuan arsenal, enhancing his troops with relatively modern artillery. Both have been united in their efforts to protect Shanxi's autonomy from central authorities, but refuse significant cooperation between commands that would allow for any meaningful integration. These dual armies are not cheap either - maintaining Shanxi's army has pushed the treasury near bankruptcy, something that has agitated both. This uneasy truce leaves many wondering how long this system can possibly last."

Units have been dissolved wholesale, officers retrained and redeployed, and the logistical chain needed to maintain these standing forces have been simplified tremendously. The bloated formations and excessive spending needed to maintain certain units that only effectively exist on paper have been eliminated.

And, more importantly, one that can be undermined and possibly supplanted by a stronger and more determined force. It might be too early for us to consider eliminating [SHX.GetLeader] from the picture. However, there is nonetheless considerable utility in pulling in a few figures our way, one at a time. Perhaps a down-on-his-luck industrialist and his corporation, the naive idealist and his students, the long-time Colonel passed over for promotion, or the disaffected landowner and their clan -there are potential candidates all along the web.

Nonetheless, there are many still begging us for help - including many merchants and industrialists in Taiyuan.

Shanxi has had a heavily state-controlled industry for nearly a decade now, which makes their business dealings both opaque and inefficient. On the other hand, they sit upon the foundations needed for a fairly successful industrialisation: widespread access to high-quality coal, cheap labour, and decent infrastructure. And they have already begun industrialisation, even if it is still in its infancy. By organising investors on our end, including both Chinese and some of our allied foreigners, as well as mixing in a few shell companies owned by our government themselves, we stand to profit tremendously by purchasing recently privatised industries and smaller companies."

 SHX_QIE_agricultural_relief_package: "山西农业救济一揽子协议"
 SHX_QIE_agricultural_relief_package_desc: "The Rural Reconstruction Movement, led by intellectuals such as Yan Yangchu (James Yen) and Liang Shuming, have long backed various programmes to improve the Chinese countryside and centralise political control. While the extent to which we entertain these ambitions have risen and fallen over the years, they do present a very unique opportunity in Shanxi itself. The province is undergoing an agricultural reform programme, and is in dire need of more funding and technical support if they are to meet the unrealistic quotas their bosses have set. Therefore, one way for us to mask our influence is to have men like Yan and Liang sponsor a bill to allocate more agricultural resources to Shanxi - with our silent but critical influence in the final product. In this way, we can begin to court Shanxi's increasingly irate gentry, long neglected by Yan and scapegoated by Feng."
 SHX_QIE_literacy_campaign: "山西扫盲运动"
 SHX_QIE_literacy_campaign_desc: "The battle against illiteracy, a passion project for many intellectuals, has taken a new turn with Shanxi's renewed commitment to improving education across the province. Yan Yangchu (James Yen) is a celebrity of sorts in the province for his years of experience battling youth illiteracy and encouraging such educational reforms, and he is willing to sponsor a bill before the National Assembly to send further educational aid into Shanxi. Naturally, of course, this has the side effect of putting many intellectuals in the province into contact with some of our own, and this diffusion of ideas will hopefully give us another in for our efforts to influence the province"
 SHX_QIE_beijing_training_group: "部署保定教导团"

 SHX_QIE_promote_chinese_unity: "促进中国的统一"
 SHX_QIE_promote_chinese_unity_desc: "尽管军阀时代带来了分裂和战争，但毋庸置疑的是，世界上有且仅有一个中国，而这一切的最终目标将是一个民族的重生。这些民族主义思想渗入了知识分子、军队甚至是最底层的农民的心中。因此，面对日本在东方日渐增强的侵略浪潮，以及他们在奉天的走狗代理人，我们必须把将外国侵略者赶出家乡放在首要地位。就我们而言，只要一个小小的推动，我们就可以轻易地在山西人民当中挑起反帝国主义热情。"

 SHX_QIE_secure_favorable_trade_deal: "确保令人满意的贸易协议"
 SHX_QIE_secure_favorable_trade_deal_desc: "山西拥有一个巨大的优质煤库，可以以非常低廉的成本大量开采。然而，由于阎锡山的无能管理致使煤矿开采效率极为低下，山西煤长期以来一直屈居在山东和湖北开采的煤炭之下。由于山东容易受到外国的威胁，而且最近局势不稳定，我们必须确保能从内地获得煤炭。话虽这么说，我们也不能相信山西的腐败领导层能管理好这一贸易，所以扩大对这一贸易路线的控制对于我们未来的安全至关重要。"

Women's footbinding was only recently fully abolished across the province, and many women remain restricted to domestic roles - expected to make the most out of the family's income and keep the household tidy and self-sufficient. All of this must change, and a greater effort towards organising women via their various organisations and convincing them to the workforce is the only way for the Ten Year Plan to truly modernise Shanxi."
 SHX_womens_college: "妇女大学教育"
 SHX_womens_college_desc: "The history of women's education in Shanxi was a difficult one. Although Governor Yan was a proponent of allowing women to attend primary schooling, he did not feel it necessary for them to attend any further classes on the grounds it was not needed to run a household. It was only after major protests that he relented to allowing women to attend colleges, where a few fortunate ones were able to learn alongside men. All of this has been changing rapidly with the resumption of the Ten Year Plan. The Women's Vocational Factory in Taiyuan has seen a swelling of students learning trade skills such as spinning, weaving and writing, though many clamour for more. The Shanxi government as a whole is reversing its stand on women's education, wanting more workers to supply its new factories and shops. Indeed, many credit the successes of socialist states with the emancipation of women, though Shanxi has a long way to go to achieve true equality."
 SHX_eliminate_academic_corruption: "消灭学术腐败"
 SHX_eliminate_academic_corruption_desc: "Teaching salaries in Shanxi are famously low, with many of Shanxi's brightest electing to join the (themselves underpaid) bureaucracy rather than be one of Shanxi's many neglected school teachers. The result is massive corruption, with teachers and professors regularly engaging in vices such as gambling, extorting parents, selling exam answers, stealing equipment and often simply not attending class. Raising salaries, greater scrutiny and an increase in spirit are vital if we are to modernise provincial education."

 SHX_cultivate_foreign_aid_connections: "利用外援网络"
 SHX_cultivate_foreign_aid_connections_desc: "Foreign aid has been vital to our province, and Westerners, as well as western-trained Chinese, have been vital to modernising our province.  John Dewey for example is a man credited as one of the inspirations for Shanxi's initial efforts at public educational reforms.\n\nWe should tap into what connections we still can, working with them to help fund our efforts, train our staff and maintain a good international profile. Furthermore, it is vital that we take some time to introspect and learn from these foreigners, ridding China's intellectuals of their outdated beliefs that history, philosophy, art and Confucian literature are the only subjects worth studying. In the end, the bulk of our efforts are our own but there is no shame in learning from others."
 SHX_expand_research_Beijing: "与北京学术合作"
 SHX_expand_research_Beijing_desc: "It was a great point of pride when James Yen visited our province to review our educational progress at the start of the Ten Year Plan in 1933 and 1935. This marked the high point of our limited, but still-existent relationship with the central government's educational establishment. Both Zhao Pilian and especially Ren Zhigong stress that this partnership could be so much more, and if the scholars at Shanxi university could connect with those of the big three northern schools of Nankai, Peking, and Tsinghua Universities, Shanxi University could soon be a peer. This dream appears far off, but with great determination and generous funding, the sky seems to be the limit."
 SHX_distribute_research_grants: "发放科研津贴"
 SHX_distribute_research_grants_desc: "Perhaps the most telling sign about the progress we have made in our education reforms is our ability to contribute to the broader academic conversation in Northern China. Although perhaps not quite on par with their peers in Beijing, Taiyuan University has been overhauled with the necessary infrastructure to produce advanced scientific, engineering, and industrial research. All they need is a little push, and through some additional funding and grants we can go a long way in improving their output."

 SHX_increase_taxes_desc: "Securing a larger share of the agricultural surplus is absolutely essential if we are to fund the necessary reforms for our province. With our new slogan, we shall begin a campaign to encourage further contributions to our provincial effort, taking aim in particular at the ill-gotten gains of the gentry. Pawnshops and other forms of usury will be heavily taxed, and land taxes shall be reformed to target the rich before the poor. They might not like it, but it is better this way than a full-scale revolution!"
 SHX_maintain_countryside: "在乡村保持均衡"
 SHX_maintain_countryside_desc: "Shanxi's rural society is a delicate one, with resentment brewing among the peasants. The only appropriate solution then is to create a more just system.\n\nFor one, taxes to village and district governments must be lowered - they are three times as high as the land tax and in any case village governments and finance bureaus are usually in the pocket of the gentry. Some even say the gentry deliberately hire ruffians to raid other towns to justify raising taxes under the guise of hiring local defence.\n\nWe will demand annual budgets and implement regular audits, which shall help alleviate some of the burdens placed on the peasants. In addition, further policing and government presence will help ensure that security and order are kept - forestalling any rural revolt.\n\nUnlike the socialist radicals in Yan'an, we will properly compensate the landowners. The value of land in the province has declined by nearly 80% due to Black Monday, and we shall offer landlords noninterest-bearing bonds that meet them in the middle - worth 50% more than their real worth.\n\nAlthough it may create grumbles from radicals and reactionaries, it is this careful balancing act that will keep our province safe and productive."
 SHX_litigation: "息讼会"
 SHX_litigation_desc: "One of the more frequent abuses done by the gentry is their utilisation of their superior resources to delay the resolution of cases at the courts, wearing out poor litigants' ability to afford lawyers. It is this kind of behaviour that has severely diminished the peasantry's faith in the government and traditional means of justice, and it is something that must be stopped if we are to keep the people's favour. Previous efforts have included moving lawsuits from the purview of local officials to formalised courts, but that too has had its flaws - with judges being accused of preferring to demonstrate their skill at abstract reasoning over dispensing actual justice. We shall instead continue to expand upon previous efforts to create a six-man \"Council for the Prevention of Litigation\" in each village, elected to membership by the villagers themselves. These councils will try to arbitrate any dispute or grievance before it is appealed to a court or a magistrate. They have already demonstrated some success in the 1920s, and it is high time that they be fully implemented across the province."
 SHX_limited_nationalisation: "有限的国有化"
 SHX_limited_nationalisation_desc: "We have already implemented dozens of programmes hoping to mobilise the common people towards our cause, but it is time that we begin to make concrete efforts at bringing under our control the arable land in Shanxi.\n\nTaught and indoctrinated towards our values at the Training Academy and the Institute of Political Administration, a new corps of district magistrates are to be given unprecedented authority over the villages. With powers such as presiding over village headsmen, removing undesirable village officials, and regular reports to Taiyuan, this new crop of magistrates will be rotated less frequently to make them less dependent on the locals for advice.\n\nSimilarly, the Association for the Promotion of Statistical Investigation of the Economies and Societies of Shanxi have aided us in publishing annually hundreds of pages of statistics on nearly every facet of life in Shanxi. This will allow our magistrates to begin a campaign of targetted nationalisation of mismanaged land while avoiding any politically expensive pitfalls that might threaten to provoke a larger reaction than we've already caused."
 SHX_intimidate_landlords: "震慑地主"
 SHX_intimidate_landlords_desc: "In response to our efforts to improve the land situation in Shanxi, many members of the gentry have utilised a variety of dirty tricks to block our efforts. These include staging protests, or ignoring our laws, bribing administrators and even hiring ruffians to attack our magistrates. It is time we lay down the law - our own militias and agitators will be deployed to the villages as a show of strength and persistently disloyal landlords will be ejected from their properties. This policy will no doubt spell some trouble, but it is important that we show we are prepared for real change and we truly stand for the common people!"
 SHX_peasant_cooperatives: "组建农民合作社"
 SHX_peasant_cooperatives_desc: "The idea of a peasant cooperative is not new, even within Shanxi, and within the confines of the Ten Year Plan many other industries have been pushed to form cooperatives. For farming, however, this is the only practical way in many cases for land to be divided - as an even split often creates plots too small to support a family. \n\nIt also better accounts for shifts in population and allows for easier government oversight and management, which will greatly enhance our efforts to rebuild the countryside and make more room for further planting. This policy is bound to attract accusations of socialism, and turn many previously fence-sitting gentrymen against the government, but will also be popular among the commoners!"
 SHX_unfair_rent: "终结不公地租"
 SHX_unfair_rent_desc: "A salient characteristic of much of Shanxi's economic system is the ability of the few with wealth and education to exploit the majority, and their ability to ignore the suffering around them. No truer is this fact than in land rents, where tenant farmers are charged exorbitant fees and interest - keeping a system of de facto feudalism. This problem is heavily localised in central Shanxi, near Taiyuan, as for much of the province peasants own all the land they cultivate or are at least semi-independent. But that is of little solace to the unfortunate many that live in overpopulated regions, with a stagnant economy that forces them to compete with one another for decreasing returns. Putting a stop to these abuses is a strict priority - the government will implement a series of rent controls on cultivated land capping it at around 10% (from over 66%), allowing the tiller to keep most of what they grow."
 SHX_land_to_villages: "一切土地归农村"
 SHX_land_to_villages_desc: "In the 1920s, Governor Yan mused about having all land be turned in to the government, who would then distribute it more equally among those cultivating it. This idea was revived at the start of the Ten Year Plan, partially buoyed by the arrival of the Guominjun.\n\nWhile it attracted considerable attention at the time, nationalising and redistributing all farmland around Shanxi, that has since faded as little has come of it. It is time for that to change, as we begin a renewed push to buy out land held by the gentry and distribute it to the peasants in a more equitable arrangement. Where there is resistance, will be targeted by a militarised effort to sweep the land to seize large and absentee landholdings from rebellious gentrymen.\n\nIt is in this way that we will make a lasting impression on the countryside, freeing Shanxi of the shackles of an outdated system."
 SHX_cheap_credit: "廉价信贷与化肥"
 SHX_cheap_credit_desc: "Farming is a very difficult profession, with the farmer being often forced to go into debt at the start of the year purchasing essential modern equipment such as fertiliser and forced to hope that the harvest will be sufficient to offset that debt at the end of the year. As a result, it is very easy for farmers to end up in chronic debt, especially after a string of poor harvests like that currently afflicting Shanxi.\n\nThe Land Reclamation Bank must be given more capital to loan out at cheap rates to help alleviate the burdens placed on our farmers. They will also be authorised to sell crop insurance, making farming a far more secure trade for the yeoman than in previous decades. This will protect them from having to turn to the harsh rates set by the gentry, which often borders (if not is outright) usury.\n\nSimilarly, a fertiliser plant must be erected, and production subsidised. This will help cut prices for our farmers, and hopefully increase output in the future"
 SHX_water_control: "治水造林"
 SHX_water_control_desc: "Water control has had a long history in Shanxi, and was one of the star reforms of Yan Xishan's early administration. Shanxi's rainfall has historically been extremely uneven and concentrated in the summer, so the Bureau of Water Control was formed with trained technocrats to build new irrigation canals and rent new machinery to the peasants to tap into the reservoirs. A parallel effort by the semi-official Society for the Promotion of Forestation was tasked with planting seedlings to help prevent soil erosion and flash floods. These efforts... while impressive in theory have often not panned out in practice. Many peasants cannot actually afford to rent the machinery offered by the Bureau and in any case, river irrigation efforts often fell short due to Shanxi's reliance on earthen dams that disintegrated each year. The trees are often left unmaintained with the exception of those built on highways - meant to show off rather than be practical.\n\nBuilding a modern Shanxi will require us to invest in modern masonry dams with check gates as well as hire sufficient foreign (and expensive) trained technicians to actually maintain hydraulic data to begin our renewed programme of water conservation."
 SHX_build_a_road: "省内道路现代化"
 SHX_build_a_road_desc: "In the 1920s, as a response to failures in distributing famine relief aid due to poor motor infrastructure, Yan Xishan put his army to work building a network of motor roads connecting Taiyuan with all of its provinces. This drastically reduced the travel time across the province, and when famine struck in 1929 it was considerably less devastating than the one a decade prior. It also helped to a slight degree, broaden Shanxi's peasants' horizons and attracted the favour of the Red Cross and China International Famine Relief Commission.\n\nBut little economic benefit has been drawn so far from these roads despite conventional wisdom. Since they were built as cheaply and quickly as possible, many were left unsurfaced and combined with Yan's decree that they be maintained and upkeeped locally, most of these roads have been either washed away or overgrown by weeds. As a result, many of these roads are now useless and the ones that aren't are so highly taxed that few use them for commercial purposes. In fact, camels and rickshaws are more popular than trucks and many roads come to an end at the borders of Shanxi province - unconnected with the rest of China.\n\nIf we want our roads to be used for anything other than military purposes, then we must invest in redeveloping our existing infrastructure and fostering domestic trade."
 SHX_connect_yanan: "到山西的铁路与公路"
 SHX_connect_yanan_desc: "Having developed our rural infrastructure and expanded crop yields, it is now vital that we have a means of transporting these goods to market.\n\nIn the 1920s, as a response to failures in distributing famine relief aid due to poor motor infrastructure, Yan Xishan put his army to work building a network of motor roads connecting Taiyuan with all of its provinces. This drastically reduced the travel time across the province, and when famine struck in 1929 it was considerably less devastating than the one a decade prior.

 SHX_upgrade_telecommunications: "扩展电子通信"
 SHX_upgrade_telecommunications_desc: "Telecommunications is another stride Shanxi has made over the years, with the Military Telegraph Bureau having installed a series of military telephones that helped suppress banditry in the province during the early part of Yan's reign. This telephone network was expanded in the 1920s, allowing for ready communications with the districts, though for the most part is still only used by the military and government. Further efforts should be made to develop Shanxi's telecommunication network both internally and to the rest of the nation, better connecting us and building the infrastructure needed for industrialisation. A similar project underway is the creation of a weather forecasting service that allows us to better prepare for adverse weather conditions and study Shanxi's climate. Although perhaps not the first priority one may think of when developing Shanxi's agricultural sector, these two investments in the long run are critical if we are to achieve true modernity."

Made up of activists aligned with our cause, they will promote the long-held narrative that buying foreign goods are unpatriotic and the only way to strengthen China is for it to live itself up. The Shanxi Marketing Cooperative for Locally Made Goods will similarly operate as a modern department store in Taiyuan to incentivise people to purchase local."
 SHX_land_bank: "利用银行业"
 SHX_land_bank_desc: "The Shanxi provincial bank, long tightly controlled by the Shanxi government and an extremely profitable venture, must be used to promote economic development. Using favourable loans to the population and taking care to keep inflation in check, we shall build Shanxi's economy from within. We will use Shanxi's money for Shanxi's people in other words - and if necessary we will also repudiate any unbacked currency and loans made to exploitative outsiders prior to 1930.\n\nTo buttress this effort, we must also secure our hold on the lucrative salt trade using our newly created North Shanxi Salt Industry Bank. Our people will be encouraged to utilise less salt, allowing us to sell more to outsiders to reverse our trade deficit. In addition, the salt merchants in our province must be kept on a tight leash, preventing needless excesses and ensuring they do not cheat taxes.\n\nOn that topic - we will be taking control of salt taxation. This is a prerogative usually reserved for the central government, but what have they done for us as of late? It won't be easy, but the people of Shanxi deserve a stable financial system and help not scorn from its bankers."
 SHX_Bureau_Econ_Controls: "经济统制处"
 SHX_Bureau_Econ_Controls_desc: "The Shanxi Bureau of Economic Controls is a vital part of our Ten Year Plan. This agency will license imports into our province, taking care to keep out unwanted foreign commodities that may unfairly compete with the honest work done by Shanxi's industrial works. Perhaps also controversially, this will also apply to products produced within China's borders outside of our controlled territories. No doubt this may hurt national unity, but sacrifices will be needed if we are to eventually save China."
 SHX_Baojin_Iron_Factory: "建造保晋铁厂"
 SHX_Baojin_Iron_Factory_desc: "The Baojin Iron Factory is the latest large-scale project Shanxi must engage in. Hydraulic equipment must be imported or manufactured, new electric furnaces installed, and workers trained. A series of roads and tracks leading to this factory will have to be constructed and locomotives and trucks procured. There is little doubt that this project will be expensive, but there is quite a few existing equipment from earlier projects that could be salvaged. And although perhaps a little old fashioned, with some ingenuity they can be turned from adequate to effective in churning out dozens of tons of steel per day."
 SHX_reinforce_bank_of_SHX: "支持山西银行"
 SHX_reinforce_bank_of_SHX_desc: "The semi-official Provincial Bank of Shanxi was historically one of the cornerstones of Yan Xishan and the Shanxi administration's power, controlling effectively all of the banking and commerce in the province. Despite being personally profitable, there are rampant fears about the stability and quality of currency in the province - at least in part due to constant wars and military spending by the Shanxi government. Efforts to back up the currency with capital have usually resulted in runs on the bank, which frequently force the bank to renege on their promises. Perhaps as a result, branch offices appear deliberately located in obscure and inaccessible places to prevent exchanging bank notes. All of this needs to change, however, if a modern economy is to be established. With an influx of foreign capital, we can at last try to back up our currency and moreover hold currency reserves from the central government and foreign governments as well. The central bank has also been attempting to establish a provincial branch office, something that should be monitored but could provide some further stability in our province. All in all, reinforcing our banking sector will set a groundwork for economic development ahead."
 SHX_wave_of_capital: "搭上外资顺风船"
 SHX_wave_of_capital_desc: "The recent surge in capital investments in Shanxi offers the promise of considerable profit in the near future. Investors have been looking into building new sugar and rayon factories, as well as dams and powerplants to supply the booming industrialisation going on in Taiyuan. As if a sign of the confidence many have in our city, two leading insurance companies have set up new branches in Taiyuan, offering a glimpse into a modern future for the city. We need to take the fullest advantage of this trend, making sure that the fruits of these projects last for generations to come. However, we must be wary that this sudden influx of new elites does not upend the old ones."
 SHX_liquidate_railroad_bank: "山西铁路银行清盘"
 SHX_liquidate_railroad_bank_desc: "The Shanxi-Suiyuan Railroad bank, established in 1936 in an effort to encourage the development of further rail connections and fund the extensive track-laying our government has been engaging in, is not likely to do much without additional investment. Therefore, taking advantage of a host of prospective buyers looking for a moderately safe investment (by Chinese standards at least), we shall begin to privatise this previously state-owned bank and allow its new owners to set their own agenda. This will reduce our logistical footprint and hopefully bring about the needed capital to develop Shanxi's railways."
 SHX_modernizing_industry_equipment: "现代化工业设备"
 SHX_modernizing_industry_equipment_desc: "Building a new Shanxi economy is not merely a matter of acquiring modern tools and machines, though that definitely helps. It is also about training the locals in modern techniques, building new supply chains, and educating new managers. The Japanese not too long ago did something similar, helping them leapfrog from a languishing secondary power in Asia to one of the world powers that could challenge even the West.\n\nYan Xishan has long theorised of the need for \"scientific management\" of industry, eliminating the corruption and nepotism that has festered in our isolation. As protectionism declines, we must encourage our business community to rise to the challenge. If necessary, forced mergers will be used to maximise production and prune out the weak branches. By asking them to embrace new methods and take on new partners, we begin a process that may not be pretty initially but in the long run, the competition will clean out the lazy and inefficient. In its place will be a modern, competitive and reborn economy fit for our model province."

Although undoubtedly Chinese for centuries now, the people of Shanxi can be provincial in nature. Despite the superficial acquiescence of the laobaixing to the grand projects of its strongmen, they still expect to benefit in return. A distant and violent war will very much destabilise the foundation in which [SHX.GetNameDef] has built its power, showing that its mandate to rule may not be as strong as they think. Beware the perception that your goals do not outstrip your ability to achieve them, lest your megalomania becomes your downfall.\n\nFrom now until our successful unification of the country we must be wary of seeing our war support bottom out. Unlike other warlords, Shanxi simply does not have the resources for a protracted war, and [SHX.GetLeader] has effectively staked everything possible into a short, decisive conflict that will see him on top. If he fails to unify the nation in the eyes of the people, then they shall soon find another champion to do so instead.\n\nNote that, even if we are able to muster a peace, the die has already been cast.

Crops grown in Suiyuan had previously disrupted Shanxi domestic production, leading to Yan arguing that the provinces were \"mutually dependent\". Feng for his part wanted to settle the region in five years, inviting poor tenant farmers from across China to settle the region and be provided with free irrigation and other tools.\n\nNow that we have obtained Suiyuan we can begin a programme to develop the land for agriculture. With nearly 4,000 acres of previously untilled land, we can distribute it to ex-soldiers of our armies as a form of quasi-retirement.

This would greatly enhance our existing iron and coal infrastructure and help fuel our industries. Suiyuan is also home to extensive coal deposits that we can exploit, further cornering this crucial market.

 SHX_suiyuan_lay_tracks_to_zhangye_decision_desc: "Continuing our efforts to connect ourselves further west into Gansu, we can now create a connection from Gansu to Zhangye.

 SHX_further_resource_extraction1_decision_desc: "Historically, much of the resource extraction in Shanxi province has been located in the eastern mountains, a source of tension between the Zhili central and Shanxi provincial governments during the early parts of the 1930s. Nonetheless, as the capital, Taiyuan is the major hub of industrial smelting and refinement and if we are to fully make use of Shanxi's numerous strategic resources it is critical that we develop our industrial infrastructure in the city. Already waiting for us is a rather large series of industrial zone established by Governor Yan, thinly hidden from the sight of Wu Peifu during his \"Ten Year Plan\". If we make the most of it, we can truly integrate the regional economy towards a national purpose."

 SHX_local_democracy: "孕育地方民主"
 SHX_local_democracy_desc: "和西方人想的那样，对于中国的内陆地区，民主不过只是美好的幻梦罢了。在山西，地方议会制度虽然早已施行，但基本上已经形同朽木——沦为地方乡绅巩固权力的工具。尽管如此，为了在农村地区对抗阎锡山，国民军利用上他们手头上的所有制度工具。"
 SHX_focus_bureaucracy: "集权省府"

 SHX_heart_washing: "重振洗心社"
 SHX_heart_washing_desc: "为了改造中国精神、促进新儒家思想，阎锡山效仿西方的教会制度，在每个城镇都建立了洗心社分会。每到星期天，分会里都会聚集许多名人，进行沉思和公开自我批评，在阎锡山的关注下，这些活动一直十分火热。20年代时，由于他的疏忽，洗心社曾经一度崩溃，但现在看来这还是很重要的。"

 SHX_christian_principles: "吸纳基督教原则"
 SHX_christian_principles_desc: "In his effort to promote a new vision for China, Feng frequently turns to virtues inspired by Christianity. Indeed, he is not alone in this regard - Christian missionaries and other Christians frequently come to Shanxi province to aid the people. While many distrust what they see as a foreign religion and the Guominjun does not require its members to be Christian, few can deny its reach in Shanxi."
 SHX_socialism: "社会主义的吸引"
 SHX_socialism_desc: "It would not be accurate to call the Guominjun a socialist organisation, despite what their opponents may say. However, the Guominjun's egalitarian ideals often cross paths with other groups who also fight for the laobaixing.

 SHX_nationalism_regionalism: "身份认同矛盾"
 SHX_nationalism_regionalism_desc: "Like many areas in warlord-era China, years of division have created endless mixed messages about nationalism, regional pride, and identity. There is little doubt that Shanxi is an integral part of a greater China, but many are wary of Beijing's intention and are happy with the significant autonomy the region has been given. This protects Shanxi and its leaders, but makes it harder for them to leave it."

 SHX_review_education_desc: "A modern Shanxi requires more than simply new machines and laws: it requires trained technicians, experienced managers and competent bureaucrats. Our shortcomings can be traced back to incomplete educational reforms. When Yan Xishan first took power, 99% of the province was illiterate. That number has dropped - but our troubles are far from done. The field of education needs our close attention!"
 SHX_student_negotiations: "与学生组织谈判"
 SHX_student_negotiations_desc: "As we renew our push to reform education in our province, it appears we have ruffled some feathers among the students themselves. Zhao Pilian, the moderate principal of our People's Normal School, shall be tasked with opening up negotiations with the apparent leaders of this nebulous body, and hopefully cool down tempers before they threaten to derail our progress!"
 SHX_parties_and_secret_societies: "党派及秘密社团"
 SHX_parties_and_secret_societies_desc: "Just because formal political parties have been banned in Shanxi doesn't mean people with vested interests and various passions have been idle. Indeed, various groups across Shanxi continue to congregate, ignoring the bored indifference of the secret police. The public outburst of the students has reminded Shanxi's leadership of the need to keep tabs on these sometimes illicit organisations."
 SHX_education_for_all: "重视基础教育"
 SHX_education_for_all_desc: "The Association in Charge of the Movement for Putting into Effect Mass Education in Shanxi has reawoken from its slumber, empowered by an influx of energised Guominjun-aligned activists. These reformers seek a continuation of Shanxi's old policies of expanding schooling opportunities for the province's destitute countryside, hoping to build a powerful foundation for Shanxi's future prosperity."
 SHX_new_intelligetsia: "新知识分子"
 SHX_new_intelligetsia_desc: "The final pieces are at last falling into place. With new scholarships being funded and educators at last being trained adequately, a more modern educational system in Shanxi can finally take root. There are plenty of shortcomings in our new system, however, the libraries are funded (and actually attended), students are finally learning useful skills, and a cadre of learned men and women taking form."
 SHX_developing_middle_class: "发展中产阶级"
 SHX_developing_middle_class_desc: "The progress being made in both education and agriculture has accelerated progress the Shanxi government has dreamed of for decades: the creation of a new class of urban professionals with money to spend on entrepreneurship and local development. Although many came from already privileged classes such as the rural gentry, plenty have been uplifted from poverty as well."
 SHX_womens_education: "扩大妇女教育"
 SHX_womens_education_desc: "Not too long ago, women were forced to fight to attend higher education, forming a Women's Association to protect that right. Now, with the increased demands on the province for trained individuals in shops and factories, the government has shifted to encouraging female enrolment - crediting the successes of industrialisation in socialist nations to the emancipation of their women."
 SHX_swords_to_plowshares: "铸剑为犁"
 SHX_swords_to_plowshares_desc: "Yan, Feng and others have quickly learned since the 1910s the need for post-military vocational training. Soldiers must be taught the necessary skills to support themselves outside of the army, lest they turn to banditry. It shall be decreed that prior to leaving service, all soldiers must learn a trade. Workshops  will be established to help teach veterans before they are released from the military."
 SHX_emphasize_higher_education: "重视高等教育"
 SHX_emphasize_higher_education_desc: "A great deal of effort has already been placed into our famed universal educational programmes, so it is high time that we begin to move on to what our province really needs: expanded technical training in science and engineering. That generation that grew up under our initial reforms shall enjoy the completion of our decade-old promise: that they will live a much better life than their parents."
 SHX_foreign_experts: "外国科学人才"
 SHX_foreign_experts_desc: "Shanxi has long relied on foreigners and foreign-trained Chinese in academia and education. While we are continuing to lessen our dependence on these missionaries and have begun to teach our students closer to home, it is too early to discount the contributions of this class of foreign-taught intellectuals in helping build Shanxi's educational base. They shall be hired to supplement our domestic efforts!"
 SHX_experimental_school_to_village: "乡村实验学校"
 SHX_experimental_school_to_village_desc: "The Governor is quoted to have said \"Technical education must be acquired on the job, it cannot be gotten simply by reading books\", and that is a principle Shanxi continues to hold. We shall expand our previous experimental school to be a model for education across the province, raising a generation of apprentices - not students - that will serve as the backbone for our future!"
 SHX_model_city_model_province: "现代城，模范省"
 SHX_model_city_model_province_desc: "If the core aim of the Ten Year Plan is to industrialise Shanxi, then the cornerstone of this plan is Taiyuan. Taiyuan is the beating heart of Shanxi's economy, and continuing our plan of aggressive state intervention in the economy is essential to develop a modern economy in the province. Nonetheless, an urgent decision must be made soon about how we will amass the resources for this undertaking."
 SHX_dig_solutions: "突破天际的山西钻头"
 SHX_dig_solutions_desc: "Our future prosperity lies beneath our feet! Having laid the industrial and commercial groundwork, we must also begin to tap into our extensive resource deposits to push our industrial economy forward. Since our trade, industry and mining are all heavily connected, this must be a concerted push. Subsidies in mining, refining infrastructure, light industry - together they feed the fires of development!"
 SHX_shanxi_solutions: "自力更生"
 SHX_shanxi_solutions_desc: "We will industrialise Shanxi using our own sweat and our own ingenuity! Shanxi has for years adopted an autarkic footing, keeping outsiders at arm's length. And we will continue to do so until all of China is liberated. Although it may not always be popular with the business class or the people, we will rally our people to make sacrifices necessary for progress. We will find the resources we need, one way or another..."
 SHX_manage_monopolies: "处理寡头"
 SHX_manage_monopolies_desc: "As part of Shanxi's \"State Capitalist\" agenda, the provincial government has acquired an impressive array of state-backed monopolies. Although our bureaucracy's technical prowess is not always up to par, we will harness what we can to mobilise the industrial sector of Taiyuan. Banks, factories, companies, mines - if Shanxi marches together we can move mountains!"
 SHX_tongpu_railway_project: "同蒲铁路计划"
 SHX_tongpu_railway_project_desc: "To continue our quest to build our economy and reverse the trade deficit, we must connect with the rest of China. Despite generating the cheapest and highest quality coal in China, the exorbitant fees charged by the German-owned Zheng-Dai railroad have made our coal uncompetitive. Breaking this monopoly is the next step to wresting away control of our future from short-sighted foreign capitalists!"
 SHX_seek_outside_capital: "寻求外资"
 SHX_seek_outside_capital_desc: "Although Shanxi has proudly carried on for years with minimal help, it is clear that if we are to accomplish our long-planned grand projects, it will not be sufficient to keep squeezing more from our exhausted population. Instead, we must raise capital from outside and use it to lift up our economy. We will use foreign money as a springboard for further development, and with any luck our national liberation."
 SHX_mass_privatization: "大规模私有化"
 SHX_mass_privatization_desc: "Significant economic quarters have come under government control over the years, leading to tremendous inefficiency as corrupt and incompetent bureaucrats stifle proper development. Meanwhile, our once-thriving salt, banking and brewing industries have since died. We must again become the heart of China's economy, starting by igniting a commercial revolution to complement our industrial revolution!"
 SHX_beijing_taiyuan_railway: "京太铁路"
 SHX_beijing_taiyuan_railway_desc: "Our economy has long been choked by limited rails and high fees, no doubt in part due to Germano-Bejing meddling. With our expanded partnerships, we have finally come to an accord that will create new lines to allow for the export of our cheap, quality coal at competitive prices. Although the focus is between Taiyuan and Beijing, smaller connections to Shijiazhuang and Cangzhou have been considered too!"
 SHX_battle_for_countryside: "巩固农村"
 SHX_battle_for_countryside_desc: "Shanxi is a province of deep inequality, and nowhere is this more pronounced than the province's rural backlands. Once the primary focus of Yan Xishan's economic initiatives, owing to his Confucian education, the 1930s drive towards industrialisation has left the perennially impoverished countryside further behind. Now, things are beginning to come to a head, as attention returns to the region."
 SHX_gentry_deal: "与乡绅交易"
 SHX_gentry_deal_desc: "The gentry of Shanxi have long been a thorn in Yan's efforts at generating meaningful changes to Shanxi's rural sector, and their obstinance is only matched by their ability to keep Yan in power so long as he is willing to cater to their whims. Keeping them pacified is essential for allowing any reforms to be implemented, and we shall start by distributing prestigious scholarships to schools in Taiyuan."
 SHX_control_gentry: "控制乡绅"
 SHX_control_gentry_desc: "Consolidating our hold on the countryside is essential, and to do that the worst excesses of the gentry must be curbed. Model village committeemen shall be deployed to the villages to convince local officials of the need to trust in the administration and put provincial interests first. This will no doubt be a hard sell, but in the end, bringing the villages to heel is necessary for the Ten Year Plan."
 SHX_peasant_deal: "团结农民"
 SHX_peasant_deal_desc: "One of Feng's more famous reforms was the creation of the Rural Training institute, which among other things, sought to train the peasants for village leadership. Although not exceptionally successful in 1927, the principle still stands - if there are to be any changes in the province then the peasants must be empowered to take charge of their own destiny, including matters political, cultural and economic."
 SHX_control_peasants: "扫除乡绅"
 SHX_control_peasants_desc: "\"Even respectable members of the gentry think it is fashionable to disregard the law, while less reputable elements delight in it!\"\n\nLong have the excess of the wealthy been documented in this province, and yet few have had the courage to stand up to them. This ends now. Aggressive measures must be taken to bring them to heel."
 SHX_land_reform: "山西土改"
 SHX_land_reform_desc: "It seems that our efforts at land reform have borne fruit, though there remains the need for some finishing touches. The Provincial College of Agriculture and its agricultural experimentation stations require more funding, which will allow for the better circulation of new agricultural techniques. These efforts will, at last, bring about some modern quality of life for the poor farmer."
 SHX_agricultural_investments: "投资农业"
 SHX_agricultural_investments_desc: "The reason why many of Shanxi's 1920s agricultural projects failed is that we tried to do too much with little planning, stretching resources thin and accomplishing nothing. Efforts at irrigation and water control were haphazard, creating an expensive failure when flooding and erosion killed crops and people alike. We need to rethink our funding priorities if we are to proceed."
 SHX_diversify_crops: "农业多元化"
 SHX_diversify_crops_desc: "在过去的十年中，人们数次将农业种植方向由谷物向经济作物过渡，但这种尝试鲜有成功，不过我们发现种植棉花的利润丰厚。如果能给予私营晋生或国营晋华这样的棉纺厂一笔额外投资，它们就可以扩大业务，并与大量涌入中国的外国产品竞争。"
 SHX_economic_restructuring: "重整经济"
 SHX_economic_restructuring_desc: "As part of the Ten Year Plan, we shall establish in every village an Economic Reconstruction Committee to draft up annual economic development plans. District planners and then the Central Reconstruction Committee shall use these local plans to create higher-level ones. This will revolutionise the countryside by acting as the spearheads for the economic reconstruction at the village level."
 SHX_weed_out_corruption: "根除腐败"
 SHX_weed_out_corruption_desc: "A variety of anti-corruption agencies are already in the works. Chief among them are the Village Inspection Committees, which will be tasked with ensuring scrutiny in the implementation of the Ten Year Plan, searching for unenthusiastic or corrupt members of the gentry and administration. Their misdeeds will be publicly shamed in a periodical known as the Supervisorial Weekly."
 SHX_reverse_the_trade_deficit: "扭转贸易逆差"
 SHX_reverse_the_trade_deficit_desc: "我们终于做到了！尽管有许多人对我们报以白眼，认为十年计划只会是又一个烂尾项目，但事实证明这项计划如今结出了累累硕果！我们成功振兴了农业和矿业，建设了新兴产业中心，并铺设了通向国外的新铁路，长期困扰山西经济的贸易逆差也终于被扭转。"
 SHX_grand_state_project: "大省工程"
 SHX_grand_state_project_desc: "With our light industry humming, our trained workforce coming to life and having amassed some (limited) capital, we need to decide on the capstone for our industrial efforts. A great feat of Shanxi engineering, sure to impress outsiders and be the pinnacle of our people's efforts. Two proposals have been brought forward by the recently formed Northwestern Industrial Company, we shall hear them carefully. "
 SHX_model_province: "模范省"
 SHX_model_province_desc: "At long last, the legendary Ten-Year Plan comes to a close. Whether it is completed early or late or on time matters little - because the accomplishment is clear for all to see. Shanxi has truly lived up to its nickname, and its governor a heroic figure both near and far. With the sacrifices demanded of the people eased, a sense of normalcy falls across Shanxi. Many wonder what the next decade will bring."
 SHX_model_province_feng: "模范省"
 SHX_model_province_feng_desc: "At long last, the legendary Ten-Year Plan comes to a close. Whether it is completed early or late or on time matters little - because the accomplishment is clear for all to see. Shanxi has truly lived up to its nickname, and its governor a heroic figure both near and far. With the sacrifices demanded of the people eased, a sense of normalcy falls across Shanxi. Many wonder what the next decade will bring."
 SHX_expand_the_xiang_jun: "乡军扩编"
 SHX_expand_the_xiang_jun_desc: "In looking towards a model to emulate for Shanxi's armed forces, we shall turn to Yan Xishan's proposal to rely on a professionally trained yet semi-active military force known as the Xiang Jun. Inspired by the American National Guard and the conscription system of Japan, the Xiang Jun will provide Shanxi with well-trained conscripts without the expense of a large military."
 SHX_integrate_irregular_formations: "整合非正规军"
 SHX_integrate_irregular_formations_desc: "虽然非正规部队在组织和士气方面都不如受过专业训练的步兵，但他们仍可以进行侦察、小规模交战、扰敌及破坏补给——这些行动在山西省的崎岖地形中尤其有用。"
 SHX_military_instruction_corps: "军事教导团"
 SHX_military_instruction_corps_desc: "A strong army in China is one led by strong and educated men, those who are willing to be an example to their subordinates. To foster a new generation of Shanxi officers, a proposal has been created to expand the Military Instruction Corps. They will be tasked to toughen up and educate recruits about Yan's peculiar ideology to strengthen their resolve and capabilities under fire."
 SHX_study_the_european_war: "研习欧战"
 SHX_study_the_european_war_desc: "阎锡山相信战争一定是持久且血腥的，同时也认为阵地战和消耗战一定要同时进行。故此，他提倡研习欧战，将两场纯粹的绞肉战——凡尔登和坦能堡战役视为典范，学习仗是怎么在现代20世纪中打的。"
 SHX_adopt_new_rifle_grenades: "采用新式步枪榴弹"
 SHX_adopt_new_rifle_grenades_desc: "虽然手雷对中国各路军阀而言不是稀奇玩意，但让我们的士兵装备步枪榴弹可以增加的他们手雷射程，比用手扔要远得多。这么做也可以提升我军的轻火力，让我们在接敌时更具优势。"
 SHX_the_chinese_spirit: "中华团队精神"
 SHX_the_chinese_spirit_desc: "我们在帝国主义列强眼中也许只是虫豸之辈，但没人可以质疑中华官兵的凶猛意志和坚韧精神。毕竟，胜利不是靠千里之外的火炮轰炸或者天上的骇人扫射得来的，而是靠天然致命的短兵交接赢取的。在这种战斗中，士兵只能依靠他手中可靠且全能的大刀活命。"
 SHX_under_yan_leadership: "服从阎长官"
 SHX_under_yan_leadership_desc: "山西军队更适合由阎锡山领导，而非将任务和命令交予下级军官。中国的政治环境里出了一批又一批贪得无厌、野心勃勃又或者指挥无能的军官。考虑到中国的前线之长，最好建立一个隶属阎长官的中央指挥部——建在前线数公里内。"
 SHX_trust_the_officers: "信任军官"
 SHX_trust_the_officers_desc: "效仿日式典范的军队必须由一位熟知其兵的将领指挥。军官必须认识他的麾下，他应当了解每位士兵的出身、样貌和性格。这样我们就可以培养热情、忠诚、服从以及舍己为人的精神。"
 SHX_encourage_moral_soldiers: "鼓励文明兵"
 SHX_encourage_moral_soldiers_desc: "当兵在中国历史的绝大部份时间里都不是个受人敬仰的职业，他们多被认为是群由政府资助的土匪而已。山西军队必须成为人民的道德模范，他们必须被塑造成一种人民信任和支持的形象。"
 SHX_prepare_for_the_storm: "未雨绸缪"
 SHX_prepare_for_the_storm_desc: "我们的敌人会从天上攻击我们，然后尝试打穿我们的山地省。我们必须设法躲避轰炸并让部队未雨绸缪。我们将会开发一条连接陕西与太原的山道网络，地下深处还设有可维持政府运作的军政机构设施。"
 SHX_renovate_the_taiyuan_arsenal: "修缮太原兵工厂"
 SHX_renovate_the_taiyuan_arsenal_desc: "When Yan Xishan took over the province of Shanxi, his motto of “Armed force is the backing of justice” demonstrated his belief in the province needing a reliable stream of local modern arms production. Construction on the Arsenal began in 1912 and since then, the arsenal is famed throughout China for producing quality machine guns, field guns, and mortars. We should take steps to expand the arsenal's capabilities in preparation for future conflict."
 SHX_invite_foreign_advisors: "邀请外国顾问"
 SHX_invite_foreign_advisors_desc: "众所周知，虽然中国有着光辉灿烂的军事历史，但近代中国的军队却无法与西方相提并论。为了加速我们的军事发展与训练，我们应该向来自[RUS.GetNameDef]、[GER.GetNameDef]或者[JAP.GetNameDef]的军官寻求建议和帮助。"
 SHX_encourage_local_gun_production: "鼓励本地枪械生产"
 SHX_encourage_local_gun_production_desc: "由于我省的地理环境，我们与中原其余地区隔绝，购买和获取外国或敌人军备都相当困难。故此，我们应该鼓励本土生产仿造设计，例如南部十四式手枪。"
 SHX_air_force: "山西空军"
 SHX_air_force_desc: "尽管中国欠缺可用于空战的现代化飞机，但山西省仍建立了山西航空学院，希望以此培训满腔热血的新兵保卫山西家园。我们也会尽力向[QIE.GetNameDef]购买一些战斗机。"
 SHX_modern_artillery: "现代化十四式加农炮"
 SHX_modern_artillery_desc: "在华北平原的大小战役中，各种榴弹炮和加农炮都被用来制造摧枯拉朽的火力。按照这种北方模式，我们将会现代化十四式步兵榴弹炮，提升其射程、准度和在糟糕地型中的机动性。"
 SHX_mountains_our_home: "山地是我家"
 SHX_mountains_our_home_desc: "我省坐落于各种丘陵山地之中，我们对本地的地形了如指掌。故此，当敌人尝试进犯我们的天然防线时，他们将会遇到最为激烈的抵抗，因为我军官兵都受过在太行与吕梁的陡峭山上战斗的训练。"
 SHX_aa_measures: "建设防空阵地"
 SHX_aa_measures_desc: "除了为我军提供天然堡垒之外，山西崎岖的地势还可以成为防空阵地的理想藏匿点和驻扎地。敌人可能认为他们可以轻易地飞入我省，但他们将无法看到我们在下方的防空炮！"
 SHX_modern_arsenal: "西北现代军工厂"
 SHX_modern_arsenal_desc: "山西军队在质量上可能仍落后于欧美俄日。不过我们为现代化太原兵工厂所做的改进和完善工作都相当成功。得益于我们的才智和努力，山西军队的炮彈也许是全国部队中最为先进的！"
 SHX_look_to_guominjun: "向国民军看齐"
 SHX_look_to_guominjun_desc: "在冯玉祥败于吴佩孚和张作霖手上后，他与国民军的老兵和残部逃到了山西。国民军是一支纪律严明的部队，他们因在战斗中和对平民的纪律良好而闻名全国。为了现代化山西省军，我们应该以他们的训练模式和纪律为榜样，建立真正专业的军队。"
 SHX_mandatory_training: "强制严密训练"
 SHX_mandatory_training_desc: "冯玉祥于1911年在东北当兵时，他见证了在当地的部分士兵是如何适应东北严冬和忍受劳累的。故此，他提倡进行高强度的体育活动，如健身、举重、障碍赛跑和体操等，以训练出全西北最为健壮的士兵！"
 SHX_standardise_infantry_education: "标准化步兵课程"
 SHX_standardise_infantry_education_desc: "虽然绝大多数中国军阀的士兵都是丈育（文盲），但冯玉祥国民军的军官们以中英日三语编撰了有关谚语、历史著作和诗词的小册子。这些小册子同时分为不同等级，让每位士兵都能够按自己的能力和进度学习。他们也会每月考试，以确保官兵温故知新。"
 SHX_towards_the_moral_army: "道德之师"
 SHX_towards_the_moral_army_desc: "山西军队注定不甘沦为唯利是图的佣兵队伍。相反，“国民军模式”提出把山西军队建设成为人民的军队；对待劳苦大众，要亲近和照顾，而不是骚扰他们。在与世隔绝的西北，我们将掀起国民革命的新一页，彻底解放我们受压迫的同胞！"
 SHX_the_peoples_army: "人民军队"
 SHX_the_peoples_army_desc: "国民军又被称为“人民军”，因为冯玉祥下令他们要尊重并向本地人民伸出援手。国民军内不允许士兵的偷窃行为，而所有为了军队利益被征用的土地都会迅速获得赔偿。在全国上下中，不少人都会对国民军的纪律及其为乡镇带来的秩序感到赞叹不已——并因此对国家军队重拾信心。"
 SHX_an_army_that_labours: "耕战军队"
 SHX_an_army_that_labours_desc: "为了完成训练，国民军士兵都需要参与公共工程，如修建水堤、渠道和道路。这不仅可以改善乡郊同胞的生活和获得群众支持，还可以为发展中的山西经济提供大批劳动力。"
 SHX_disclipine_and_loyalty: "纪律与忠诚"
 SHX_disclipine_and_loyalty_desc: "军队里并不单有步兵。士官、厨子、铁匠、军号手和驯兽员都一定要成为能打胜仗的军人。所有在山西军队中的成员，不论身任何职，都应当练习枪法和研究兵法，以确保他们不会因不忠或者准头太差而无法杀敌。"
 SHX_infilitration_tactics: "渗透战术"
 SHX_infilitration_tactics_desc: "在烟雾和火力支援下，我们将冲破并击溃敌军防线。在小规模的协同火炮打击下，我们训练有素的专业士兵将会用决心和大刀推向敌军防线，并以纪律和近乎狂热的爱国主义为盾穿越敌方炮火。"
 SHX_whampoa_of_the_north: "北方黄埔"
 SHX_whampoa_of_the_north_desc: "Like the famous military academy opened by the late Dr Sun Yat-sen in Guangdong, the generals of Shanxi do hope to turn its military curriculum into that of “the Whampoa of the North.” The doctrines taught in the halls of Shanxi's military academies will be similar to that of the Kuomintang, such as infantry tactics from Russia and the Syndicalist nations. It is here in the Chinese Northwest where the revolution may finally succeed."
 SHX_political_commissars: "推行政治教育"
 SHX_political_commissars_desc: "我们应该采用西式做法，以政治教育为手段培训士兵并确保他们忠于上级与省府。然而，对于应该引入冯玉祥国民军的政委抑或由阎锡山亲自任命军官，军队内意见相左。"
 SHX_improve_our_logistics: "改善后勤"
 SHX_improve_our_logistics_desc: "在省内大多数道路都相当落后且我军没有补给系统的情况下，我们应该购入卡车以改善我们的后勤能力并确保部队能够在前线吃饱穿足。"
 SHX_our_natural_defenses: "天然屏障"
 SHX_our_natural_defenses_desc: "Shanxi is a mountainous province and has earned a reputation for being a tough nut to crack as her narrow valleys, steep mountains, and rocky valleys have proved difficult for invading armies to break time and time again. We shall strengthen our natural defences by creating foxholes, trenches, bunkers, and other encampments in order to better strengthen our defences."
 SHX_integrate_the_armies: "整合两军"
 SHX_integrate_the_armies_desc: "时机已到，冯玉祥和阎锡山的部队必须合二为一，成为属于山西政府的省军，只有接纳一省一军才能拥有真正一支训练有素的现代化军队。整合两军固然会影响两位将军的权力斗争…"
 SHX_out_of_beijing: "摆脱北京的阴影"
 SHX_out_of_beijing_desc: "The events of the last year have shown that the government in Beijing no longer holds any sway over the numerous warlord cliques vying for power across China. As tensions mount with the ever-present threat of the Fengtian Clique in the Northeast, let us prepare to negotiate our status as a province with the Central Government in the coming days. The choices we make there will decide where we stand in this age of divided states."
 SHX_recognize_gov: "承认北京政府"
 SHX_recognize_gov_desc: "The negotiations with [QIE.GetNameDef] have been a complete success and our leaders have agreed to recognise Beijing's claims to sovereignty over the rest of China. In exchange for recognising the Central Government in Beijing as the National Government of China, we hope that the Beijing Government will address our territorial concerns and reward us accordingly for our loyalty."
 SHX_destiny: "山西向前进"
 SHX_destiny_desc: "It's clear from the fallout of negotiations with the Central Government, that our ambitions will merely be constrained and limited by Beijing. Shanxi's development over the course of Black Monday and our military prowess display the fact that Shanxi's destiny is far greater than merely being subordinate. Opportunities await for those who will seize to take them!"
 SHX_joint_training: "华北平原联合军演"
 SHX_joint_training_desc: "As part of our fruitful relationship with the Central Government, we will organise a large-scale military exercise programme between the Shanxi Clique and [QIE.GetNameDef]. Not only will this strengthen bonds between the armies of both cliques but this will also prepare us for the coming battles and wars across China."
 SHX_negotiate_trade: "协商贸易条约"
 SHX_negotiate_trade_desc: "Our economy has long remained tied to the Central Government in Beijing and its hold over Shanxi's developing economy can be at times both a blessing and a curse. While we are thankful for the economic aid and cooperation fostered by Beijing, our economy's growth is severely limited by the economic investments that businesses in [QIE.GetNameDef] have over us. Let us approach the Beijing Government in hopes of renegotiating the trade treaties due to our continued loyalty and support."
 SHX_northern_war_plan: "北方战争计划"
 SHX_northern_war_plan_desc: "Soldiers follow orders but it is the generals behind the lines who make decisions that ultimately decide the fate of a battle.

 SHX_shanxi_baoding: "鼓励参加保定军校"
 SHX_shanxi_baoding_desc: "The Baoding Military Academy is the premier military institution in North China and is reputable for its famous alumni, with its cadets eager to learn the ways of modern war in order to help transform China's backward armies.

 SHX_vanguard_of_north: "北方先锋军"
 SHX_vanguard_of_north_desc: "With our position in North China secured, we are fit to declare ourselves the Central Government's strongest military force in the Chinese Northwest. Yet there may still be regions far from the control of the Central Government that will require our military intervention. As the newly proclaimed Northwest China Political Council, our mission is to ensure that the country in the North and West are reunited once and for all."
 SHX_xibei_loyalty: "确保西北稳定"
 SHX_xibei_loyalty_desc: "Formally part of the Central Government, the Hui clique of Xibei San Ma, broke off during the chaos of early 1936. Let us seek to demand their submission to the Central Government so that the western frontiers of our country shall be secured."

 SHX_cut_qie_ties_desc: "Too long have we found ourselves shadowed by the Central Government in Beijing to the East. Yet, there are signs... signs that the times are changing and that our future may be more malleable. The economic collapse of 1936 showed that Beijing's government over us is weaker than what one might be led to believe. Let us seek to slowly break free from our chains and pursue Shanxi's true destiny away from Beijing's shadow."

 SHX_war_plan_desc: "We face an enemy with numbers numerically greater than ours, with an industry nearly tenfold of what we are capable of. In the face of such adversity, we shall plan our every step - setting up reconnaissance positions deep behind enemy lines while also tracking enemy movements. A larger enemy does not necessarily entail victory; careful and strategic planning makes the fatal difference between victory and defeat."
 SHX_mobilisation: "舍身获救赎"
 SHX_mobilisation_desc: "One cannot expect victory without sacrifices, without losses. As the province prepares to enter its greatest crisis yet - let us cast away divisions and seek nothing more than the complete annihilation of the enemy. Each man and woman throughout the province from Taiyuan to Yan'an will be expected to perform their duty without a single breath of hesitation. To arms once more!"

 SHX_cloak_dagger_desc: "While many throughout China may deride our tactics as \"cheap\" and \"unlawful,\" our experience in the mountains and rural dry fields of the province has shown us time and time again that it is those who know the terrain who will achieve victory. While the enemy may expect to meet us on the open battlefield, we shall strike them from behind, pierce them in the rear, and bring them the terror of a modern guerrilla war."
 SHX_defend_resist: "保卫山西，寸土不让！"
 SHX_defend_resist_desc: "The enemy is at the gates and the situation indeed grows dire day by day. In this time of crisis, all must be called up from their homes, their fields, and their schools to participate in the war of national liberation. For each inch of land, we will make them pay two-fold in blood. For each town or village lost, we will make them suffer and regret ever stepping foot in our province!"
 SHX_beyond_borders: "冲出省界"
 SHX_beyond_borders_desc: "In one fell swoop, the Central Government of [QIE.GetNameDef] has utterly collapsed. In the wake of such a change in the political landscape, it is clear that our ambitions have clearly greater goals and that we are indeed fit to carry out the long-awaited unification of our country. From the mountains of Shanxi, the flames of revolution continue to burn bright and we shall liberate our nation once and for all!"
 SHX_central_plains_government: "中原政府"
 SHX_central_plains_government_desc: "Having secured our grip across the central plains in northern China, we may now venture to stake our own claim for national leadership, transforming ourselves from a mere warlord state to one of several competing claimants for the legacy of the Xinhai revolution. This growth in legitimacy comes with considerable responsibility, however, and should not be taken lightly."
 SHX_suiyuan_question: "绥远问题"
 SHX_suiyuan_question_desc: "Suiyuan, to the east has been long sought by those who rule Shanxi as a potential means of enhancing Shanxi Province's productivity. The region is rich and full of iron and has plenty of uncultivated lands, lands that could be used to meet the needs of Shanxi's increasingly demanding province. Let us approach the Ma Clique and the Central Government in the hopes of achieving a mediated settlement."
 SHX_suiyuan_order: "恢复秩序"
 SHX_suiyuan_order_desc: "With our recent righteous acquisition of Suiyuan, there are certainly those who resist our control and see us as nothing more than enemy occupiers. Let us reach out and tender to the people while encouraging settlement from Shanxi villages, so that we may be able to restore order in the region."
 SHX_suiyuan_connect: "联通诸省"
 SHX_suiyuan_connect_desc: "Years of neglect by the Ma Clique over the region of Suiyuan has rendered the region's infrastructure vastly inferior to the rest of China. Let us seek to connect the newly gained province with our home regions in Shanxi and Shaanxi to facilitate transportation, trade, and order."
 SHX_national_leadership: "宣称国家领导权"
 SHX_national_leadership_desc: "Having bested our northern rivals, we have become another claimant to the legacy of the Xinhai legacy, given an opportunity to right the wrongs of the past and bring the hopeful change of the Beiyang Republic that never was. Still, there are plenty of other pretenders out there and as we navigate the challenges of being a national government, we must be wary not to let our guard down."
 SHX_national_army: "由省军走向国军"
 SHX_national_army_desc: "At the end of the day the army that won us our great victories thus far is not up to the standards a great power would require. If we are to complete our revolution, unite our people, and drive out the imperialists, then we must utilise our newly found resources to modernise and expand our capabilities. But we will never forget the brave spirit our men have carried from Shanxi to [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]!"
 SHX_build_a_navy: "复兴北洋水师"
 SHX_build_a_navy_desc: "For centuries China was a maritime power, but the humiliating defeats inflicted upon us by the Japanese and Westerners have shattered our national pride. The prolonged land-based fighting in the Warlord Era has stripped critical resources for maintaining a fleet worthy of a great nation, something that must be quickly restored if we are to defend our extensive coastline."
 SHX_dockyards: "船坞扩建计划"
 SHX_dockyards_desc: "Due to its geographical location, few in Shanxi would have ever imagined the need for a navy. With the restoration of the Republic of China under the leadership of the Shanxi Clique, we now hold the capabilities to create and establish a national navy. As part of our greater national efforts to improve and modernise our navy, let us embark on a rapid expansion programme to create new dockyards!"
 SHX_coastal_forts: "未雨绸缪"
 SHX_coastal_forts_desc: "我们应注意到，如今守卫着海岸线的防御工事已经过时或荒废了，作为海军现代化尝试的一部分，我们正起草一项计划，为相关建筑人员及工程师拨款，用以研究雷达技术及实现岸防工事的现代化，相信这些能够帮助我们守卫中国的海岸线，抵御潜在的登陆入侵行动。"
 SHX_final_battle: "最后一战"
 SHX_final_battle_desc: "Despite our victory over the Japanese imperialists in the Second-Sino Japanese War, with their advantage at sea - the arrogant Japanese refused to return our island of Taiwan to the Chinese Republic after the ceasefire. Thanks to the success of our naval modernisation programme, we now have the capabilities to challenge the Japanese and fight them once more to reclaim the island of Taiwan for China!"
 SHX_national_air_force: "建立保定航校"
 SHX_national_air_force_desc: "Although during our tenure in Shanxi we've entertained various airborne projects, neither strongmen truly had the resources to develop a worthy air fleet. It is imperative if we are to keep up with developments in military theory that we begin building a national air force capable of challenging the skies. Moreover, it would be a great force multiplier against any remaining warlord forces."
 SHX_utilise_arsenals: "利用军阀兵工厂"
 SHX_utilise_arsenals_desc: "As our forces sweep across China with the fervour of unification, we have seized multiple abandoned arms factories and arsenals left behind by their provincial warlords. Like Yan, many have built up arms-production facilities of their own over the years. Let us utilise these arsenals and upgrade them so that they may serve the needs of the nation rather than another power-hungry regional tyrant."
 SHX_chinese_marines: "民国海军陆战队"
 SHX_chinese_marines_desc: "While lacking a maritime tradition, the first Marines of the Republic of China trace their lineage to the Wuchang Uprising of 1911. While originally a \"Navy Guard\", a standard Marine Corps was established in 1914 although efforts to modernise and create a standard marine division have since then fallen short. Let us continue their legacy by creating our very own republican marines that will protect our shores!"
 SHX_new_methods: "拥抱新战术"
 SHX_new_methods_desc: "The tragic irony of the warlord era is that with all the spending placed on maintaining regionalist forces, the Chinese nation has been unable to afford modern military formations on a meaningful scale. Since the last nationwide reforms to the military in the Self-Strengthening Movement, warfare has greatly transformed. Nimble tanks and trucks have replaced the old cavalry, but they will not outpace us."
 SHX_future_of_war: "未来的战争形势"
 SHX_future_of_war_desc: "\"Quickness is the essence of war\", and as the world changes so too does the nature of conflict. Planes, tanks, and battleships may make the headlines in their glamour, but as we chase the future of warfare we must not forget some of the other critical developments as well. Planning, coordination, and doctrine are all essentials to today's wars, and as a new day emerges in Baoding, we must not forget them."
 SHX_rural_reconstruction: "乡村建设"
 SHX_rural_reconstruction_desc: "The Rural Reconstruction Movement, founded by intellectuals Yan Yangchu (James Yen) and Liang Shuming was conceived with the desire to revive the Chinese village. Although we were divided by their support for Wu Peifu across the early 1930s, James Yen was a tremendous help in devising our educational reforms. Their ideas for the modern Chinese countryside are expected to likewise be a major success."
 SHX_stabilise_national_economy: "稳定国民经济"
 SHX_stabilise_national_economy_desc: "The enemies of the battlefield are but one foe we must vanquish. The threats of hyperinflation and bankruptcy stalk us as we not only inherit Beijing's authority but also its copious debts. Through a careful mixture of taxes, seizing enemy assets, cutting wasteful spending, and securing foreign loans, we can stave off economic catastrophe and win over the support of the business community."
 SHX_mass_education_reforms: "推动扫盲运动"
 SHX_mass_education_reforms_desc: "One of the great ambitions of various Chinese intellectuals over the last few decades has been the promotion of universal education, which many hope will uplift the Chinese people and restore the nation to its previous cultural and economic dominance. We ourselves have worked tirelessly in this regard back in Shanxi, and it is time that we engage with northern scholars to promote this noble national endeavour."
 SHX_tie_up_ends: "实现中华统一"
 SHX_tie_up_ends_desc: "Although [SHX.GetLeader] has secured his place as a leader among the Chinese people, there remain other strongmen and warlords vying for control of the land. Eliminating our rivals and asserting our authority over the warlords is integral towards our long-held aim of national unification, as is the elimination of secessionists. With our banners raised, we shall sweep away anyone who dares to stand in our way. "
 SHX_reject_humiliation: "一雪百年国耻"
 SHX_reject_humiliation_desc: "Millennia of Chinese peace and splendour came to a crushing end with British aggression in 1839. Since then, Chinese authority has unravelled, with many Chinese cities on the coast being handed over to foreign powers. Now that our nation is once more on the rise, their sun sets in the east. We shall drive out the wretched imperialists from Chinese land, liberating our people from their exploitation!"
 SHX_revolutionary_republic: "中华复兴"
 SHX_revolutionary_republic_desc: "The Chinese nation has at last been restored under one republic, our Republic of China. With the imperialists vanquished, their concessionist cronies evicted, and secessionists, regionalists and warlords all brought to heel, we can finally end the destruction and focus on rebuilding. At last, the idealistic dreams of Xinhai can be reborn, able to take flight over the darkness that had engulfed our nation."
 SHX_tender_to_the_people: "福，禄，寿"
 SHX_tender_to_the_people_desc: "The Sanxing refer to the mythical deities in Chinese folk religion associated with a good life. These are Fortune (Fu), Prosperity (Lu), and Longevity (Shou). As we have taken the mantle of national leadership, in exchange for the people's loyalty we must in turn provide and tend for the laobaixing. This means ensuring not only strong government and armies, but also a robust welfare state."
 SHX_fund_national_academies: "资助国家教育"
 SHX_fund_national_academies_desc: "Years of warfare and brutality have left little money or attention to academia, with many of our brightest minds going abroad - never to return. The ones that have stayed often find themselves pressured to make themselves useful for the various warlords, either as a means of propaganda or military innovation. As we return to a state of peace, as a nation we can once again focus on civilian studies and research."
 SHX_legacy_of_gmj: "国民军遗风"
 SHX_legacy_of_gmj_desc: "The Guominjun was an army built by Feng Yuxiang to liberate the laobaixing and restore morality to a land ravaged by foreign pillagers and domestic tyrants. As we disarm and move towards civilian rule, we must not forget the sacrifices our brave soldiers have made. Pensions and honours aside, it is vital that their spirit, discipline, and revolutionary zeal are never lost in our new China. May even our fallen heroes know their children grow up in a changed and better land."
 SHX_ten_aims: "十大施政目标"
 SHX_ten_aims_desc: "Years ago, when Feng Yuxiang first took command of Kaifeng, he released a list of Ten Immediate Aims to clean up the corruption he found and alleviate the suffering he saw. Decades later, as he settles into a new capital as the new master of China, the decisions he takes next will have effects that reverberate across the nation. With gusto, the new rulers hurry to set a positive example for the provinces."
 SHX_comrades: "我们的革命同志"
 SHX_comrades_desc: "Although we have done the lion's share of the work in building the new republic, we must not forget the millions of fellow travellers who have likewise sought a free and democratic state. Although in the strife of the past few years we may have clashed with some of them, the reality is many have benevolent ideas worth considering as we craft our own national policy. Hearing them out may have its benefits."
 SHX_new_life: "新生活，旧传统"
 SHX_new_life_desc: "Feng Yuxiang has promoted what he called the New Life Movement, an effort at renewing the Chinese character and instilling proper morality among the people. As we pursue a reborn Chinese nation and people, we must be quick to embrace the positives of change but also retain the positive traditions that make up the Chinese identity. It is in this way that we truly break the shackles of warlordism."
 SHX_realise_revolution: "实现革命目标"
 SHX_realise_revolution_desc: "It is not enough to simply throw out the old corrupt dictators in Beijing and elsewhere, or oust other warlord contenders that sought national power. If we are to truly win over the decades of discord warlordism has brought, then we must bring about change to the very bottom of the social ladder. We must commit ourselves to the total liberation of the laobaixing, under the careful guidance of Feng Yuxiang."
 SHX_from_china_to_world: "从中国走向世界"
 SHX_from_china_to_world_desc: "China is a great nation, with a great destiny. It has long served as a protector of peoples in the east, a role that it will once more assume under Feng Yuxiang's reborn republic. Under our watchful patronage, we will cast off the yoke of Western imperialists and restore the peace that once existed in Asia. Our armies march not just for the sake of our people, but all those around us."
 SHX_national_heart_washing: "中国哲学"
 SHX_national_heart_washing_desc: "Yan Xishan has proposed, in his wisdom earned through decades of practical experience, a refined version of his ideology he calls the \"Philosophy of China\". This collection of principles, thoughts, and practices honed in by our beloved junzi, an epitome of Confucian wisdom, shall ensure that China never again falls back into the squalor that has defined its existence for the past century."
 SHX_tradition: "传统与进步"
 SHX_tradition_desc: "Yan Xishan's greatest strength as a leader is his ability to take new concepts and technology and synthesise it with the best of Chinese traditions and values. This has allowed him to make great strides in modernising Shanxi, allowing him to serve as the progressive but wise leader needed to lift China back to the role it was meant to play in the world. Under President Yan, our future is bright!"
 SHX_national_government: "无党派政府"
 SHX_national_government_desc: "Yan Xishan is a member of no party, believing himself above the petty squabbles of bickering lobbyists. Instead, he is a statesman, a President capable of bridging divisions and ending the needly partisanship that has long consumed democracies. If our republic is to work, we must find common ground, and our wise leader will ensure that the best ideas the nation's intellectuals can conceive will enter into policy."
 SHX_model_to_system: "从模范到制度"
 SHX_model_to_system_desc: "In the humble province of Shanxi, Yan Xishan's brilliant leadership transformed it into a prosperous and stable oasis amidst the dark days. It is there that Yan became an envy of other provinces, a leader the nation begged to take charge. Yan will never forget, however, his roots in the \"Model Province\", and the successes there ought to be studied by future bureaucrats in the decades to come."
 SHX_father_of_nation: "国父"
 SHX_father_of_nation_desc: "Many men tried to secure the loyalty of China through the bayonet, crushing the people under their boot. Not Yan Xishan. Like a father, he protects his people, his men, and his nation. He teaches them what they need to know, he guides them through hard times, he provides for them, and he sets an example for them to follow. China is being reborn in its founding father's image, and he proudly watches as it takes its first steps into its future."
 SHX_statesman: "国际政治家阎锡山！"
 SHX_statesman_desc: "阎锡山当初不过是一个封闭省份的督理，就已明白国际媒体曝光度的重要性。如今，他作为新中华民国的代言人，正在努力让人看到新政权的仁慈，同时也维护其在东亚的权威。中国将再次崛起为一个大国，带领亚洲人民抵御外国侵略者。"
