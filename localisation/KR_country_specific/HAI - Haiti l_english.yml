 HAI_continue_council_desc: "达蒂格纳夫总统任职期间，历来受法律保护的参议院被替换成了一个临时机关。这一举措本应只维持一年，事实上却延续到了今天。相比于恢复参议院，我们反而应该将这个机构从宪法中删去，同时确定国务委员会的地位。"
 HAI_define_executive: "规定行政权力"
 HAI_define_executive_desc: "正是因为宪法对部分行政权的定义过于模糊，卡利斯特才有机会把国家推到悬崖边上。是时候悬崖勒马了，我们要与议会两院协作，对宪法的相关条文进行修正，从而精确定义各机构的地位、限制民选官员凭借上级任命兼任多职。"

 HAI_housing_projects_desc: "在城市中，非正式的定居点占了大头。幸运的是，建筑业的新发展有可能帮助我们解决这个问题。国家应该在这些定居点修建标准化的高密度公寓楼，并把他们租给以前的非法占用者。"

 HAI_new_constitution_desc: "尽管1932年宪法遵循了传统，但也体现了海地民主的所有错误，并告诉我们：现在的海地离国父们的理想还有万里之遥。必须起草一份全新的文件来建立一套更彻底的民主政治制度，并削减行政权力。"

 HAI_parliamentary_desc: "为了防止权利的滥用，总统这一职位不应该握有实权，大部分的行政权将被移交给国会议长。当然，过渡是循序渐进的，我们会留给莱斯科总统足够的时间让他参选议员和议长。"
 HAI_presidential: "总统制共和"

 HAI_workers_rights: "扩大工人权利"
 HAI_workers_rights_desc: "Haiti has long oscillated between domination by foreign interests and protectionism. We should instead harness the foreign for the benefit of the people of Haiti.

 HAI_subservient_assembly: "屈从的议会"
 HAI_subservient_assembly_desc: "While we agree that democratic values are essential, democracy can be dangerous in these unstable times. We have witnessed even the fall of the North American giant, and clearly, democracy could not save them there.

 HAI_institutionalize_guarde: "扩大海地警卫队"
 HAI_institutionalize_guarde_desc: "The army has long served as the bulwark of the people against domination by the political elite.

 HAI_haitian_caesar: "海地的凯撒"
 HAI_haitian_caesar_desc: "Like the great Caeser who led Rome to glory after securing it from his rivals, so has Calixte marched in Port-au-Prince in similar triumph!

They will aid in the construction and development of our cities and our infrastructure so that Haiti will be one of the most developed nations in the Caribbean."
 HAI_education_reform: "开始教育改革"
 HAI_education_reform_desc: "Our country lags behind much of the Caribbean when it comes to literacy; despite the Caribbean being very much underdeveloped in education, Haiti's illiteracy rates are particularly abysmal.

 HAI_education_spending: "增加教育开支"
 HAI_education_spending_desc: "Our initial education reforms have been successful! We have received word that day and day, more Haitian children are attending school, but still, this is not enough.

 HAI_expand_welfare_state: "福利国家扩张"
 HAI_expand_welfare_state_desc: "Black Monday severely crippled our nation, putting more people out of work and onto the streets than ever before. Despite our slight economic recovery, it will take more than just the free market to help those who are struggling. The government will ensure that those who are desperate will have their needs care for - in these stressful times, the government must be looking out for their people."
 HAI_begin_industrialization: "开始工业化"
 HAI_begin_industrialization_desc: "With the assistance of our technical advisors and our growing financial reform, our next project in fully developing our nation is the start of industrialising Haiti. While we are indeed a tiny nation, we have the resources and space to begin industrialisation. Thanks to Calixte, Haiti will soon be the Caribbean's most premier economy."
 HAI_business_subsidies: "本地企业补贴"
 HAI_business_subsidies_desc: "Black Monday hit many local businesses hard; without the protection of their government - many companies were forced into bankruptcy. Now that our economy is slowly recovering, it is time to re-invest in our civilian economy. To encourage the growth of businesses, the government will grant them subsidies as an investment and help companies get back on their feet."
 HAI_state_work: "国家就业计划"
 HAI_state_work_desc: "With the worst of Black Monday over, many Haitians still remain unemployed. This provides the Haitian government with a free workforce, and we can use this manpower to build government projects such as government housing, infrastructure, and schools. Not only will we be able to develop our economy, but this also gives plenty of Haitians the ability to work once again."
 HAI_infrastructure_expansion: "基础设施扩展"
 HAI_infrastructure_expansion_desc: "As part of our state work programmes, we will take steps to build infrastructure in Haiti - most of our network consists of poorly paved roads, and in some areas roads are simply non-existent. The political turmoil of the last years has also degraded what little we had, making it difficult for our people to use them as our nation's economy rises again. We will undertake an modernisation programme to build up Haiti's infrastructure while also providing jobs for Haitians."
 HAI_seize_american_assets: "收缴美国资产"
 HAI_seize_american_assets_desc: "The United States has clearly positioned itself against us and our future. Ever since their unlawful occupation of the islands, Haiti has been exploited repeatedly by our giant of a neighbour. As a result, the operations of American companies in Haiti and any assets must be taken over by the state to better serve the Haitian people. No longer shall we bound to the chains of the Yanks - their industries are rightfully ours!"
 HAI_electrification_program: "开始电气化项目"
 HAI_electrification_program_desc: "Haiti has lagged decades behind much of the rest of the world in bringing electricity to the masses. Outside of the wealthier parts of Port-Au-Prince, electricity is the exclusive domain of the state. We must at last address this issue."
 HAI_housing_program: "新住房计划"
 HAI_housing_program_desc: "Thanks to Black Monday and the years of political turmoil, many Haitians are out of their homes. We deeply care for the plight of our fellow Haitians, and thus we will take steps to resolve this. With aid from the government, we will begin a rigorous project to build up government housing. This way, we can provide Haitian citizens who are less fortunate with cheap accommodations and so that they can finally have a roof over their heads."
 HAI_financial_control: "主张财政控制"
 HAI_financial_control_desc: "Our economy has long been tied to that of the United States, and it would not be out of place to say that Haiti was indeed an American puppet. This made us incredibly weak and reliant on American goods, but not anymore. With the American giant involved in their own civil war, we can finally assert ourselves financially. Our nation will finally unlock our economic potential; no longer will we be reliant on others!"
 HAI_mining_sector: "发展矿业部门"
 HAI_mining_sector_desc: "Our nation's natural wealth remains mostly unsurveyed and unexploited. A state mining company should be established to finally survey what lies beneath our nation and put our natural resources fully to work."
 HAI_subsidize_foreign_business: "补贴外国企业"
 HAI_subsidize_foreign_business_desc: "While we have developed our internal economy, Haiti has many resources that other nations would be interested in investing in. To further encourage investment in Haiti, we will provide subsidies to businesses. This will make other countries more eager to invest in our future, helping us finally rid ourselves of our financial problems."
 HAI_new_economy: "新经济"
 HAI_new_economy_desc: "When Black Monday hit Haiti, observers believed that this would spell a decades-long doom for us and that we would never recover to a pre-depression level economy. Calixte's government has proven them wrong, and now Haiti stands more robust than ever; our economy is finally booming. The worst days of the depression might be mentioned in our history books, but our nation will now experience a new economy, a new era of prosperity and wealth for all Haitians!"
 HAI_mission_to_ottawa: "遣使渥太华"
 HAI_mission_to_ottawa_desc: "With the collapse of the United States as an economic hegemon on the North American continent, we must look northwards. The Canadian-led Entente Alliance may be a potential trade partner given their economic alliance of the IEDC. We should send a delegation to formally open up relations between our two countries."
 HAI_trade_wif: "为西印度群岛舰队提供设施"
 HAI_trade_wif_desc: "Our neighbour, the West Indies Federation is a member of the Entente sphere. Providing additional facilities to the Royal Navy stationed there will help increase our ties."
 HAI_natfrance_ties: "与法国重建关系"
 HAI_natfrance_ties_desc: "While relations between France and Haiti have been strained in the past given the fact that Haiti was indeed once a part of the French colonial empire, as we grow closer to the Entente we should re-establish our ties with the French state. We will strengthen our ties with the French people through our shared interests and values."
 HAI_iedc_engineers: "获得帝国经发委工程师"
 HAI_iedc_engineers_desc: "As part of the Entente's economic community, we will have access to the IEDC's resources. The IEDC leadership has declared that they are willing to invest in Haiti's economy, and send engineers to our island nation to help on projects such as developing modern infrastructure."
 HAI_join_isac: "加入帝国科委"

 HAI_entice_german_investments: "吸引德国投资"
 HAI_entice_german_investments_desc: "Haiti contains resources that Germany is interested in, such as sugar and coffee. In addition to these industries, the Germans are also interested in developing our tourism industry. To increase Haiti's economic productivity, we will encourage the Germans to come and bring their businesses to Haiti; with the hopes that they will see Haiti as a worthy investment partner."
 HAI_subsidize_german_business: "资助德国企业"
 HAI_subsidize_german_business_desc: "The German Empire has few investments in the Caribbean, but now that our cooperation is increasing, we should seek to change this. To encourage further German investment, the Haitian government will offer subsidies to potential investors - this way, they are more likely to establish businesses in Haiti."
 HAI_purchase_german_arms: "购买德国军火"
 HAI_purchase_german_arms_desc: "The German army is the strongest in the world and has the most modern equipment. Haiti's arms industry is small, and most of our weapons come from foreign suppliers anyway. As part of the increasing German-Haitian cooperation, we will begin buying arms from the German Empire. Our soldiers will be equipped with the most modern weapons and supervised by German officers who are eager to train our army."
 HAI_attract_german_immigration: "吸引德国移民"
 HAI_attract_german_immigration_desc: "Starting in the mid-1800s, Germans began arriving in Haiti due to our nation's limited competition and openness to free trade. While the Germans made up a minority of the Haitian population, the Americans seized German possessions during their occupation. Now that Haiti is free, we will return these possessions to their respective owners and encourage German immigrants as a new era in German-Haitian cooperation begins."
 HAI_place_in_the_sun: "阳光下的地盘"
 HAI_place_in_the_sun_desc: "With Haiti entirely in the German sphere, Haiti will now do its best to defend the interests of Germany in the Caribbean. The Germans will use Haiti as a coaling station to monitor their interests in the Caribbean while also safeguarding our nation from foreign aggressors. To that end, Haiti will help Germany accomplish their place in the sun while also transforming our state into a modern Caribbean nation."
 HAI_mission_to_france: "遣使公社"
 HAI_mission_to_france_desc: "诚然，海地是一个法语国家。鉴于法兰西公社的反殖民主义立场，我国将着手与法公社建立外交关系，并承认其为法兰西的合法政权。有了公社的保护，我国便能从企图利用海地的帝国主义列强的阴霾下取得独立。"
 HAI_join_phalanstere: "加入法伦施泰尔"
 HAI_join_phalanstere_desc: "With the establishment of diplomatic and commercial relations with the Commune of France, we have been given the option to formally join the Phalanstère. This will allow the Internationale to aid in our developing economy through investment, technology sharing, and giving us the tools necessary to build a modern economy."
 HAI_trade_mission_internationale: "赴第三国际贸易使团"
 HAI_trade_mission_internationale_desc: "We will send a formal delegation to the tremendous socialist powers of Britain and France to negotiate trade and commerce between our nation and the Third Internationale. As diplomatic ties between Paris and London grow, we will encourage the Internationale to send us advisors and immigrants to help transform our developing nation into a Caribbean power."
 HAI_attract_3I_investment: "吸引第三国际投资"
 HAI_attract_3I_investment_desc: "Our nation struggles to modernise and economic development while present still lags behind the rest of the western world. However, due to our growing cordial ties with the Internationale, the nations of the Internationale have expressed their desire to invest in our country. With their aid, we will be able to accelerate our modernisation."
 HAI_continental_navy_base: "建立大陆海军基地"
 HAI_continental_navy_base_desc: "The old United States has fallen into civil war, and the old regime has been swept away by a revolutionary socialist one. While the new socialist America has promised to protect Haiti without interfering in our affairs, they have requested that we grant them a naval base to ensure security in the Caribbean. This will strengthen ties between our nations, but it will also encourage cooperation in maritime affairs and give us much-needed protection."
 HAI_army: "海地武装部队"
 HAI_army_desc: "While originally a mere gendarmerie, the Garde d'Haiti has evolved into a full-fledged army. It and our growing border force must attain complete parity with hostile forces."

 HAI_expand_defenses_desc: "Despite persistent conflict with the Dominicans, no Haitian administration has properly fortified any section of the border. To augment our border units and ensure security should open conflict break out, we should harden the path to Port-Au-Prince from Santo Domingo."
 HAI_elite_army: "精锐军队"
 HAI_elite_army_desc: "While the Garde was organised around an American-trained core, the largest share of the rank-and-file do not measure up. We should draw down the size of Garde and focus resources on training and supplying our units."
 HAI_centralized_high_command: "最高指挥部集中化"

 HAI_decentralized_command: "最高指挥部去集中化"
 HAI_decentralized_command_desc: "While politicking by Garde officers has sparked criticism and calls for greater central oversight of provincial officers, such a solution is far from ideal. We should instead empower such officers, granting them sole discretion over many key areas of strategic importance."
 HAI_nco_training: "新士官培训"
 HAI_nco_training_desc: "The conflict at the border has provided the men with critical combat experience. Proposals to loosen restrictions on-field promotions for the rank and file have proliferated among Garde command and should be carried out. Many on the border have shown themselves more than capable to serve in an NCO capacity."
 HAI_improved_training: "改进军官培训"
 HAI_improved_training_desc: "A new officer school employing accredited foreign instructors should be established."
 HAI_professional_army: "专业军队"

 HAI_citizen_soldiers: "公民士兵"
 HAI_citizen_soldiers_desc: "Irregular formations have been essential to keeping order in Haiti.

 HAI_prepare_total_war: "准备总体战"
 HAI_prepare_total_war_desc: "While Santo Domingo behaves cordially in formal diplomatic channels, its domestic rhetoric and frequent border provocations belie its true intentions. War, at this point, seems inevitable. We must prepare to confront the Dominicans once and for all."

 hai.2.t: "黑色星期一波及海地"
 hai.2.d: "Disaster! Following the collapse of the German economy, German businesses and American financial institutions have sent shockwaves through Haiti. With unemployment already rampant in Haiti, this crisis is bound to exacerbate this issue. All the reforms that President Calixte has passed in the past few years are for nought."
 hai.2.a: "我的天哪！"
 hai.3.t: "Lescot Denounces Presidential Overreach"
 hai.3.d: "As President Calixte leaned hard on members of the Council of State and the National Assembly, the leader of the main opposition Elie Lescot denounced President Calixte in a speech to the National Assembly. While it may strengthen the resolve of opposition Deputies, Lescot has never liked Calixte and his speech will change few minds."
 hai.3.a: "He doesn't matter."
 hai.4.t: "Centrist Councillor Speaks out"
 hai.4.d: "In a harsh critique of President Calixte's electoral campaign, a centrist councillor has denounced Calixte as being undemocratic and borderline dictatorial. He claims that the practices made by the Calixte regime will bring an end to Haiti's democracy."
 hai.4.a: "让他闭嘴。"
 hai.4.b: "Let him go."
 hai.5.t: "A Proposal from Casséus"
 hai.5.d: "As the election intensifies, we can dash away any hopes of a landslide victory. The election will most likely be bitterly contested and close. In order to increase our chances of winning, we may consider some \"other methods\" such as using the names of the deceased on ballots. This is only for the security of Haiti, as Calixte only has good intentions for our beloved nation."
 hai.5.a: "It must be done for the preservation of Haitian democracy and order."
 hai.5.b: "So this is how democracy dies...with thunderous applause."
 hai.6.t: "Scandal on Campaign"
 hai.6.d: "Somehow while on the campaign trail, it was revealed that several members of the Garde d' Haiti had taken bribes from the Dominican Republic. Some claim that the bribes go as high as President Calixte himself. While the Garde's loyalty to Haiti is beyond doubt, this may be difficult to overcome politically."
 hai.6.a: "Acknowledge that it is an issue that must be investigated."
 hai.6.b: "Deny these crimes!"
 hai.7.t: "议员宣布支持卡利斯特"
 hai.7.d: "It would appear that our efforts have bore fruit. Thanks to Calixte's charisma on the election trail and some \"motivations,\" a number of assemblymen from the various departments have declared their support for Calixte."
 hai.7.a: "胜利在望！"
 hai.8.t: "普里斯-马尔斯仍存疑虑"
 hai.8.d: "The prominent doctor and politician Jean Price-Mars has spoken about his doubts toward President Calixte's regime. While Price-Mars has agreed with the President's left-leaning views, he has repeatedly denounced the President's authoritarian tendencies."

 hai.10.t: "让·普里斯-马尔斯抨击卡利斯特"
 hai.10.d: "Price-Mars has denounced Calixte as a despot, claiming that Calixte's tactics and policies will only spell for democracy in Haiti. Given the doctor's popularity among the educated and his own support base, this is a serious setback for the Calixte movement."
 hai.10.a: "蠢货。"
 hai.11.t: "卡利斯特宣誓就任司法部长"
 hai.11.d: "With it clear that President Calixte will not win reelection in the National Assembly, his advisors have devised a scheme through which he will stall ratification and continue to govern as de facto president through the cabinet. As the Haitian constitution is not clear what happens if no president is selected by June 10, it is widely accepted that the former president's cabinet would continue to rule the nation. With President Calixte now also a member of his own cabinet, he can continue to govern even after his term has expired."
 hai.11.a: "这主意谁想的，真是天才！"
 hai.12.t: "国民议会抗议"
 hai.12.d: "Declaring our campaign as one that is fraudulent and full of corruption, members of the National Assembly have protested against us. They have pledged to do everything in their power to block Calixte from gaining the presidency. Our hold throughout the nation is quite secure, and these fools will soon learn that they will be on the wrong side of Haitian history."
 hai.12.a: "关我们什么事？"
 hai.13.t: "Councillors Caught Colluding with Lescot"
 hai.13.d: "We have received news that some of the councillors are outright colluding with Elie Lescot. While we do have a fair amount of support on our side, this gives Lescot's side an advantage. While we can just let them be, to solidify our chances of victory we can ask the Garde to persuade them otherwise."
 hai.13.a: "Arrest them, and issue pardons for their votes."
 hai.13.b: "Let them go."
 hai.14.t: "海地警卫队的新指挥官"
 hai.14.d: "The time has come to appoint a new commander for the illustrious and elite Garde d'Haiti. The institutionalists in the National Assembly support Alfred Auguste Nemours, while many in President Calixte's inner circle support Paul Magloire, a young officer loyal to Calixte personally and politically."
 hai.14.a: "选择内穆尔。"
 hai.14.b: "马格卢瓦尔一贯忠诚。"
 hai.15.t: "美国崩溃"
 hai.15.d: "一件无法想象的事情发生了：长久以来，美国虽饱受动荡与经济混乱的困扰，但其在加勒比地区的持续存在也能让海地成为事实上的傀儡。这些年间，海地痛苦辗转，美国海军陆战队给我们国家带来的只有苦难。美国所要求的条款只是将徭役制施加于海地，使海地再次沦为奴隶国家，这种日子一去不复返了。新世界的巨人已然屈膝下跪，陷入全面内战之中。毫无疑问，他们已不能如同帝国主义者那般统治我们，束缚在海地身上的锁链再次破碎。"

 hai.17.d: "While [HAI.GetLeader] has tried hard to crack down on Dominican excursions over the border, his efforts continue to be remanded by his field commanders. A junior officer has reported that the Dominicans have bribed these commanders to stay quiet and refuse to crack down on the Dominican soldiers."
 hai.17.a: "We must crack down on the Dominicans!"
 hai.17.b: "We cannot afford to catch these traitors."
 hai.18.t: "海地大批逮捕官员"
 hai.18.d: "Reports from our border agents indicated that the officers we bribed have been arrested. While this has not helped them solve the underlying problem of corruption in their ranks."
 hai.18.a: "We must continue to undermine them."
 hai.19.t: "Haitian Officers Successfully Bribed"
 hai.19.d: "Our spies across the border and informants in our own army units reported that in the last few weeks Dominican officials have issued another round of bribes to our officers in the field. Coinciding with reports from the same units that there has been no activity from the Dominican side of the border, we can assume that these officers are not to be trusted."

Even though it is no longer led by President Calixte, one questions whether its power is still too great."
 hai_cal.3.a: "Its power must be diminished"
 hai_cal.3.b: "It is our pride, we must maintain law and order!"
 hai_cal.4.t: "Victory!"
 hai_cal.4.d: "President Calixte has led us to victory in the civil war! The last of Lescot's militias escape to the hills to fight a desperate guerilla campaign, and the traitor Lescot himself has surrendered. President Calixte has decided to merely put him under house arrest, as it is clear his political power has been sapped."
 hai_cal.4.a: "A parade is in order!"
 hai_cal.5.t: "Choosing a New Benefactor"
 hai_cal.5.d: "As the United States is embroiled in turmoil and their presence has become more and more chaotic over the past few months, many in our government have suggested that we turn to a new great power to both help us secure our debt and protect us from other powers."
 hai_cal.5.a: "Germany has supported us in our struggle, there is no question!"
 hai_cal.5.a_spd: "With the SPD in power, bowing to German influence is the only option."
 hai_cal.5.b: "We are socialists, we must align with the Internationale!"
 hai_cal.6.t: "Opening of the German Base in Cap-Haitien"
 hai_cal.6.d: "As part of our agreement with the German government in exchange for debt relief and economic investment, we have leased Germany some land in the port city of Cap-Haitien to build a naval base. As Germany attempts to project power in the Caribbean, we may now be the central staging area for further German expansion in the region."
 hai_cal.6.a: "This is the best trade deal in the history of trade deals!"
 hai_cal.7.t: "保罗·马格卢瓦尔以辞职表示抗议"
 hai_cal.7.d: "卡利斯特总统手下的一名重要尉官保罗·马格卢瓦尔于昨日辞职，以表示他对卡利斯特拒绝编写新的民主宪法的抗议。这位被认为具有左翼立场的将领或将准备前往法国，在流亡中支持海地的小型左翼运动。"
 hai_cal.7.a: "无所谓。"

 hai_cal.8.a: "马格卢瓦尔将军肯定能胜任。"
 hai_cal.9.t: "Proposing the Haitian World Exposition"
 hai_cal.9.d_1: "As Haiti rebuilds itself from the destruction of the civil war, some Haitians are proposing that we show the world that we are not the backwater that many believe. As a demonstration of the modernity of black culture, the exposition will show the urban beauty of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's desire for international cooperation, as well as Haiti's unique culture and historical monuments.\n\nThe proposal calls for a gateway arch, a new convention centre, and a massive infrastructure improvement to cater to the foreigners that will arrive. All in all, it is an extremely ambitious project, but one that will hopefully yield tremendous economic, diplomatic, and political results for Haiti."
 hai_cal.9.d_2: "As Haiti transitions to its new government, some Haitians are proposing that we show the world that we are not the backwater that many believe. As a demonstration of the modernity of black culture, the exposition will show the urban beauty of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's desire for international cooperation, as well as Haiti's unique culture and historical monuments.\n\nThe proposal calls for a gateway arch, a new convention centre, and a massive infrastructure improvement to cater to the foreigners that will arrive. All in all, it is an extremely ambitious project, but one that will hopefully yield tremendous economic, diplomatic, and political results for Haiti."
 hai_cal.9.a: "A worthy endeavour!"
 hai_cal.10.t: "The Rising Costs of the Haitian World Exposition"
 hai_cal.10.d: "While construction on the arch and convention centre are proceeding on schedule, the cost of labour and material is far above budget. As it is far too late to cancel the project or scale back, we have no choice but to allocate more funds."
 hai_cal.10.a: "It will be worth it in the end...right?"
 hai_cal.11.t: "The Opening of the Haitian World Exposition"
 hai_cal.11.d1: "The Haitian World Exposition opened today with massive crowds greeting the foreign dignitaries and marvels that awaited them. The Arch and convention centre were completed on time, though well over budget, as representatives from the Commune of France, the Papal States, Argentina, Cuba, Guatemala, the Socialist Republic of Italy, Mexico, Venezuela, and the West Indies Federation were all in attendance.\n\nA telegram from French Chairman [FRA.GetLeader] was read aloud along with a parade by a small company of Communard soldiers. Many of the dignitaries gave glowing reviews of both their accommodations and the opening ceremonies."
 hai_cal.11.d2: "The Haitian World Exposition opened today with massive crowds greeting the foreign dignitaries and marvels that awaited them. The Arch and convention centre were completed on time, though well over budget, as representatives from the German Empire, the Papal States, Argentina, Cuba, Guatemala, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, Mexico, Venezuela, and the West Indies Federation were all in attendance.\n\nA telegram from German Kaiser [GER.GetLeader] was read aloud along with a parade by a small company of German soldiers. Many of the dignitaries gave glowing reviews of both their accommodations and the opening ceremonies."
 hai_cal.11.a: "A fantastic start!"
 hai_cal.12.t: "The World Exposition a Success!"
 hai_cal.12.d: "Following the closing ceremonies, President Calixte received word from his foreign office that messages of congratulations have been arriving all day congratulating Haiti on its tremendous accomplishment. It is clear that we have changed the worlds' view of our nation."
 hai_cal.12.a: "A remarkable event!"
 hai_cal.13.t: "The World Exposition a Failure!"
 hai_cal.13.d: "Following the closing ceremonies, President Calixte received word from his foreign office that while a few messages of congratulations had come in, the exposition had mostly fallen flat. After the initial excitement about the expo had worn off, most of the dignitaries found themselves bored and unimpressed. Despite all the money put into the event, there seems to be little to show for it."
 hai_cal.13.a: "Get me the organiser of this charade on the line!"
 hai_cal.14.t: "President Calixte Visits a Cockfighting Ring"
 hai_cal.14.d: "As cockfighting is an extremely common sport in Haiti and throughout the Caribbean, it was only a matter of time before President Calixte made his way to a public match. Claiming that he was a fan of the sport while a child and teenager, the President appeared to enjoy watching the two cocks attack each other. He did not take part in any betting, but did seem to know what to do and when, much to the approval of the locals in attendance."
 hai_cal.14.a: "Always fun to see a couple cocks going at it!"
 hai_les.1.t: "海地上议院问题"
 hai_les.1.d: "In the constitution written in the late 1910s by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave, the document outlined a Senate which would serve as an upper house to the National Assembly. However, the Americans preferred to use the Council of State, a much smaller body and one they could more easily control. They insisted that upon withdrawal, they would reinstate the Senate. However, when former President Borno was elected in 1932, he refused to reinstate the Senate, and instead also preferred to deal with the Council of State.\n\nWe now have the option of continuing to use the Council of State, or resurrect the Senate."
 hai_les.1.a: "维持国务委员会。"
 hai_les.1.b: "重新召集参议院。"
 hai_les.2.t: "海地宪法问题"
 hai_les.2.d: "The Haitian Constitution has been through so many changes and revisions some completely question its authority. However, many also argue that it has withstood numerous tests, including the recent election and strife between President Lescot and former President Calixte. President Lescot must now decide whether to write a new constitution, or continue with the old version."
 hai_les.2.a: "起草新宪法！"
 hai_les.2.b: "维持旧宪法。"
 hai_les.3.t: "President Lescot Addresses the National Assembly"
 hai_les.3.d: "President Lescot addressed the National Assembly yesterday to update them on the writing of the new Constitution. Many of Lescot's advisors now question whether we should adopt a parliamentary government, much like the ones developed and used in Europe and in Canada. Others advocate for the presidential republic that we have had for decades."
 hai_les.3.a: "Lescot will continue the authorities of the Calixte presidency."
 hai_les.3.b: "Lescot pledges to devolve further authority to the legislature."
 hai_les.4.t: "Should we invite Jean Price-Mars into the Government?"
 hai_les.4.d: "Following the speech by President Lescot, some in our government have proposed inviting Jean Price-Mars, leader of the Progressive Party into the government. A liberal at heart, yet wary of authoritarians, we may be able to convince him that we mean well and gain his powerful voice for our government."
 hai_les.4.a: "He would be a worthy partner"
 hai_les.4.b: "Never!"
 hai_les.5.t: "Victory!"
 hai_les.5.d: "President Lescot has led us to victory in the civil war! The last of Calixte's militias escape to the hills to fight a desperate guerilla campaign, and the traitor Calixte himself has surrendered. President Lescot has decided to merely put him under house arrest, as it is clear his political power has been sapped."
 hai_les.5.a: "A parade is in order!"
 hai_les.6.t: "Lescot Opens the New Legislature"
 hai_les.6.d: "Following the general elections, President Lescot opened the new legislative session with a speech to the National Assembly. He praised the democratic spirit of the Haitian people, and decried the reactionary populism of former President Calixte."
 hai_les.6.a: "An excellent speech!"
 hai_les.7.t: "Choosing a New Benefactor"
 hai_les.7.d: "As the United States is embroiled in turmoil and their presence has become more and more chaotic over the past few months, many in our government have suggested that we turn to a new great power to both help us secure our debt and protect us from other powers."
 hai_les.7.a: "Germany has supported us in our struggle, there is no question!"
 hai_les.7.b: "The Entente nations are our natural allies!"
 hai_les.8.t: "The Question of the Garde"
 hai_les.8.d: "Long an institution of black leadership and abused by the former dictator Calixte, the current leadership of the Garde d'Haiti has been a pain to deal with for far too long. Many also claim that it is an outlet for black social mobility and without it, they would turn to revolution. At least while as a member of the Garde they can be watched and controlled. As a result, many claim that we should keep the Garde as is so as not to upset its leadership structure."
 hai_les.8.a: "The Garde needs a change of leadership."
 hai_les.8.b: "Keep the Garde as is."
 hai_les.9.t: "Vincent's Proposal"
 hai_les.9.d: "Leader of the Nationalist Party Sténio Vincent met with President Lescot today at the Presidential Palace. In the meeting, Vincent strongly denounced the presence of the syndicalist Parti Socialiste Populaire. He named them as un-Haitian, traitors, and spies for the 3rd Internationale. He officially asked President Lescot to not only denounce their activities, but actively ban them from organising and meeting."
 hai_les.9.a: "He is right, they are too dangerous to be left alive!"
 hai_les.9.b: "That would only strengthen them."
 hai_les.10.t: "Whispers of Rebellion"
 hai_les.10.d: "President Lescot is not popular among the largely black populace. However, he remains secure through his brutal network of police chiefs, known as section chiefs which alert the Minister of the Interior Georges Léger to any rumblings of rebellion within army garrisons, through maroons in the wilderness, or any general discontent on large farms. Léger has reported to us that there is some chatter in the army over whether Lescot is truly the man for the coming war against the Dominicans, or whether former President Calixte's lieutenant Paul Magloire would be more suited for the job. While this may sound dangerous, these are low-level officials, and Léger has made it clear that there is no wider discussion of a coup plot."
 hai_les.10.a: "必须严防死守。"
 hai_les.11.t: "最高指挥部改革问题"
 hai_les.11.d: "With President Lescot's announcement that the high command of the Garde d'Haiti would be completely reformed, many of the lower-level black officers have had issues with this development. While they aren't numerous enough to make a serious challenge, it could still hamper the efficiency of the reforms. We can ask the section chiefs to crack down at individual army units, or we can organise around them, knowing they are discontent."

 HAI_jean_price_mars_leader_desc: "A Haitian doctor, teacher, politician, diplomat, writer, and ethnographer, Jean Price-Mars served as secretary of the Haitian legation in Washington D.C. and as chargé d'affaires in Paris during the Weltkrieg. Taking his surname from his mulatto father and the mulatto writer Hannibal Price, Price heard stories of Haitian folklore from the earliest days of youth - giving him the respect of Haitian traditions. Price-Mars is a champion of Négritude, the belief in a shared \"black\" consciousness among the African diaspora, and a prominent advocate of voodoo as a complete religion.\n\nHis political ideology stems heavily from the resistance of Haitian peasants towards the American occupation, and he heavily despises the Haitian elite for their seeming ineptitude to provide for the masses. Inspired by the novel \"Madame Bovary,\" Price-Mars coined the term \"collective bovarysme\" to criticise Haitian elites of mixed white ancestry whom Price-Mars blames for holding unfair economic and economic positions in the country. A critic of Haiti's crippling illiteracy, Price-Mars believes that universal education will lead to an advancement of society. Fully embracing Haiti's history of slavery, Price-Mars believes the Haitian slaves were the true source of Haiti's traditions and history. He admired the slaves' culture and religion as a base of resistance towards the European colonisers - the foundation of a Haitian nation that he seeks to emulate. "

 HAI_elie_lescot_leader_desc: "President Elie Lescot was originally a pharmacist in Port-de-Paix, in the north of the country. A representative of the interests of the mulatto elite, he entered politics before the Weltkrieg and then took on several posts in the governments of Louis Borno and Demosthènes Calixte. He however never relinquished his independence, and made alliances only out of pure interest. Comforted by his favourable standing among the Americans and the Germans, Lescot was able to take power following the fall of President Calixte. Lescot now plans to bring liberal and democratic reforms to Haiti, and to dismantle the socialist-inspired policies of Calixte. The issue of constitutional reform is one that is still to be answered for the new government. As Lescot's attachment to democracy is debatable, it is unsure how much say the President plans to give to democratic institutions."
 HAI_stenio_vincent: "斯泰尼奥·樊尚"
 HAI_stenio_vincent_leader_desc: "Sténio Vincent is an old character of Haitian politics. Already active before the Weltkrieg, he was briefly the mayor of Port-au-Prince from 1907 to 1909, and was a member of Dartiguenave's government from 1916 to 1917. A member of the Conservative Party, he first supported the American occupation before radically turning against it in the 1920s. From then on, Vincent was constantly a leading figure of the opposition as the head of the Nationalistes, opposing both Louis Borno and Démosthènes Calixte for their collaboration with the American occupiers. The victory of President Vincent in the 1940 elections came as a surprise to many of the elite, but well-informed observers have known for long his popularity among the popular strata of the capital. His platform, revolving mostly around the end of American occupation and national independence, appeals to the Haitian masses who hope to one day see their country free of foreign influence."

 HAI_franck_lavaud_leader_desc: "Born in the west of Haiti, Franck Lavaud graduated among the top of the Military Academy and rose rapidly through the ranks of the Haitian army. Reaching the post of Chief of Staff of the Garde under Elie Lescot's presidency, he was then appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Haitian army. The commander always stayed far from politics, and is dedicated above everything else to the good of his country. This is what motivated him to move against President Lescot after his failure dealing with the Dominican Republic. The weakness of the president would have led to the weakness of Haiti, which Lavaud can't accept. \n\nLavaud announced already that he doesn't mean to rule for long, as he is not a politician. His main goal is to organise elections and ensure the peaceful continuity of the Haitian state. \n\nIn much the same way and despite his apolitical position, Lavaud grew to despise the factionalism riddling Haitian politics and regularly leading the country to international humiliation. The general, supported by the armed forces and a large part of the population, thus intends to suspend political life until the stability and strength of Haiti can be restored."
