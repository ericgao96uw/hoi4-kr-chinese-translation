 GRP_cristiano_cordeiro: "克里斯蒂亚诺·科代罗"
 GRP_cristiano_cordeiro_leader_desc: "Hailing from the small town of Limoeiro, Cristiano Cordeiro started his career in public services early, working at the state treasury while still a law student at the University of Recife. A veteran of the syndicalist movement in Brazil, Cristiano was one of the founding members of the PSB, and worked in organising strikes both big and small in Recife for decades, while also acting in defence of the workers as a city councillor and other minor legislative positions. While he himself always positioned himself against a revolution enforced by military means, he nevertheless is the greatest syndicalist leadership in the states that form the federation, and thus was selected by its unions as its first chairman, while also receiving support from foreign syndicalists. His key policies are centred against combating hunger and extreme poverty that have devastated the states of the north ever since colonial times, but he also holds stances in favour of defending the rights and lands of the native peoples, who were the primary victims of the feudalistic practices of the local powerful landowners, the coronéis."
 GRP_joao_fernandes_campos_cafe_filho: "小若昂·费尔南德斯·坎波斯·卡费"
 GRP_joao_fernandes_campos_cafe_filho_leader_desc: "Born in Natal in 1899, João Fernandes Campos Café Filho performed as a young man the typical path of Brazilian politics, working on journalism and studying law before managing a spot in local legislatures, but with the key difference of having played football professionally for Alecrim FC during the waning years of the Weltkrieg. Having positioned himself strongly in favour of the opposition in the interstate war, Café holds a strong belief in modernising the country, but also in democratic principles he often found were seldom respected by his peers in the old Brazilian legislatures. A Presbyterian Protestant, Café Filho is a part of a minority in the intensely Catholic Guararapes, but despite what foreign observers might infer, it's an extremely secondary matter, for his biggest issue when taking the rulership of the federation will be the local elites, the coronéis, whose influence and wealth made them historical political kingmakers in the region. He, however, counts as his ally the extremely influential João Pessoa, and has significant, even if broad, popular support for his democratic and liberal ideals."
 GRP_osvaldo_lima_filho: "小奥斯瓦尔多·利马"
 GRP_osvaldo_lima_filho_leader_desc: "Osvaldo Cavalcanti da Costa Lima Filho was born in the town of Cabo de Santo Agostinho, is a young and energetic right wing radical and former member of the AIB. His political career began as early as 1936, where he partook in the street battles in Recife against syndicalist rabbles, and has since become one of the key agitators of Integralist ideology in the region. While he, like many integralists in the northeastern part of Brazil, never held any significant monarchist beliefs, the movement enjoyed his support as he saw the republic as little more than a failed experiment in its current state. Being a law graduate, Osvaldo wishes to re-establish the rule of law cross the Confederation; and to do so, he prepares an extensive plan of investigations and arrests against traitors and terrorists, some of whom have roamed the nation freely for decades. To this end, he is organising a reformed secret police department, backed by the remnants of integralist militias, whose members still remember their faith and duty to God, and will not hesitate to carry out this regrettable yet necessary task to establish peace in the newly founded republic."
