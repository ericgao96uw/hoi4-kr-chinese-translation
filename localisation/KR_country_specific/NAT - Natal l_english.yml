 NAT_natal_rings_true: "纳塔尔的建国钟声！"
 NAT_natal_rings_true_desc: "经过针对比勒陀利亚伪政府的漫长斗争，我们，英王陛下最忠诚的子民，终于解放了年轻的国度。现在是卸甲归田，休养生息的时候了。"
 NAT_native_question: "土著问题"
 NAT_native_question_desc: "尽管我们不再是南非的一部分，我们继承了它最恶劣的遗产：少数白人统治着多数非洲人。昔日南非的常态已被推翻，我们必须直视这一问题。"
 NAT_speak_softly: "轻声发言"
 NAT_speak_softly_desc: "尽管纳塔尔的白人无法想象放弃权力垄断，部分人感到第三次布尔战争颠覆了常态，政府必须重新审视它与原住民的关系。德班的自由派呼声越来越高，要求政府转向宽松政策。"
 NAT_work_with_native_trade_unions: "和土著工会合作"
 NAT_work_with_native_trade_unions_desc: "一段时间以来，当地人中具有阶级意识的人一直在组织自己的工会，从而能更好地协调他们的活动。虽然这其中最大的工会——工商业职工联盟——被普遍认为是站在工团主义一边的，但它并非是一个铁板一块的组织，也不是纳塔尔唯一的工会——这意味着存在一些达成共识的空间。"
 NAT_organise_the_native_workforce: "土著劳工监管法案"
 NAT_organise_the_native_workforce_desc: "滥用土著劳工在南非已是通病。这些工人一向没有多高的工薪，也没有法律保护，1924年《产业调和法案》有意将黑人排除在外。现在，与工会数月的交涉之后，《土著劳工监管法案》通过了，它将更好的保护所有工人的福祉。"
 NAT_recognize_zulu_paramount_chief: "承认祖鲁大酋长"
 NAT_recognize_zulu_paramount_chief_desc: "自从祖鲁部族被征服，英国和南非政府都拒绝承认祖鲁国王继承人的地位。1933年的继位危机更是加深了不定性。现在祖鲁人构成了我们国家不可或缺的一部分，为了国家稳定，是时候拥立一位祖鲁大长老了。"
 NAT_encourage_zulu_communalism: "鼓励祖鲁社团主义"
 NAT_encourage_zulu_communalism_desc: "大多数纳塔尔土著人口属于祖鲁部族，他们各自具有独特的传统。纳塔尔政府希望通过鼓励部族建制，承认并扶持酋长权力并发给酋长津贴，从而扶植起一种祖鲁部族的社群意识，以作为工团主义的替代，并遏制国内的革命倾向。"
 NAT_collaborate_john_dube: "与杜贝合作"
 NAT_collaborate_john_dube_desc: "John Dube, leader of the African National Congress, has been a well-known native rights activist for decades, striking a conservative course while still advocating for legal equality for the African population. In a bid to circumvent the radical ICU and the divided Zulu chiefs, some negotiationists among the government have looked to his figure as a means of finding a palatable path towards reform."
 NAT_establish_the_land_settlement: "确立土地授予"
 NAT_establish_the_land_settlement_desc: "As advocated by Dube, the government in Durban has drawn up a plan to extend the amount of land allocated to be owned unconditionally by the native population. It is hoped that, by extending land-holding rights to more natives, they can be drawn away from more radical politics - why would they want to overthrow a government that gave them land?"
 NAT_state_sponsored_native_education: "国立土著教育"
 NAT_state_sponsored_native_education_desc: "The native population has lacked education for as long as we have been on the shores of Natal, as white-dominated government have previously shown no interest in extending education to them. No longer - pursuant to our new conciliatory strategy, the government has decided that the Zulu peoples will get state-sponsored education to increase their overall welfare."
 NAT_establish_native_council: "建立土著委员会"
 NAT_establish_native_council_desc: "People are satisfied with their government when they feel that said government is acting in their interests - and one of the easier ways to do this is to give them representation in the government. To this end, a native council is to be established, in order to advise the government on the affairs of the native peoples."
 NAT_carry_big_stick: "手握大棒"
 NAT_carry_big_stick_desc: "While they have asserted their independence from South Africa, the ruling white minority does not feel as secure as they'd like - like the government it seceded from, the Natalian state fundamentally fears the onset of radicalism among the native African majority that it governs. Hardliners among the government have been pushing for harsh measures to ensure that syndicalism finds no foothold in Natal."
 NAT_suppress_ICU: "压制工商业职工联盟"
 NAT_suppress_ICU_desc: "The Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, the largest trade union in the country, has made substantial inroads into Durban within the last decade - a fact that horrifies the Entente-aligned white government of Natal, who see the union as a vehicle for syndicalist activity. The government, looking to assert itself, has already begun to crack down on ICU activity and arrest known syndicalist sympathisers."
 NAT_root_out_syndicalism: "在土著中清除工团主义"
 NAT_root_out_syndicalism_desc: "A full-blown red scare has gripped the halls of government - with every known syndicalist arrested, fear of 5 more unknown ones dominates the minds of the white population. Attention has increasingly shifted away from the cities and towards rural areas, where it is feared that syndicalists may find support among natives - whether the fears are founded are not, a new crackdown is already underway."
 NAT_asiatic_question: "亚裔问题"
 NAT_asiatic_question_desc: "Although certainly a minority compared to the native population, Natal is home to a substantial Indian diaspora, the legacy of indentured servants brought over from British India. While not as pressing an issue as native relations, the Indians are not a small group, and are both economically significant and politically conscious of their persecuted status - and so clarification of their relationship with the government is necessary."
 NAT_restrict_indian_land_ownership: "挫伤印度裔投机商"
 NAT_restrict_indian_land_ownership_desc: "The white settler population has long looked at the Indians of South Africa with suspicion - they have often set up small businesses that are able to outperform their white competition. White-run businesses are more than eager to get an edge on their rivals, and have been been pushing Durban to find ways to restrict Indian business \"for the sake of national security.\""
 NAT_provoke_indo_zulu_antagonism: "挑起印度与祖鲁族裔间的敌意"
 NAT_provoke_indo_zulu_antagonism_desc: "Despite their shared history of persecution at the hands of the white South African government, Indians and the Zulu have not always been on the same page - the cultural gap between them is quite large, and it wouldn't take very much to spark hostility. The government, desperate for ways to feel less vulnerable, is not above trying to prevent these two groups from uniting against them."
 NAT_full_immigration_stop: "彻底禁止印度移民流入"
 NAT_full_immigration_stop_desc: "The flare of anti-Indian sentiment that has been stoked by our government is starting to reach its natural conclusion - several members of Parliament have decried the continuing influx of immigrants as a destabilising factor, and have petitioned the government to block their furthered entry into the country. Given the recent anti-Indian stance of the government, Durban seems poised to take up the request."
 NAT_suppress_natal_indian_congress: "镇压纳塔尔印度人大会"
 NAT_suppress_natal_indian_congress_desc: "As the primary interest group for Indians in Natal, the NIC has fallen increasingly under pressure in the face of a wave of anti-Indian sentiment across the country. Now they have become the targets of a red scare, with their opponents in government charging them as proxies of the Indian National Congress and other enemies of the Crown - a connection that might exist for some, but others say is not true for the whole organisation. The distinction does not seem to matter to the government."
 NAT_Asiatic_land_tenure_act: "亚裔土地保有法案"
 NAT_Asiatic_land_tenure_act_desc: "A bill originally suggested before the Third Boer War, the Asiatic Land Tenure Act - derisively known by the Natal Indians as \"the Ghetto Act\" - is designed with the intent of greatly restricting the ability of Indians to own or occupy property outside of certain designated zones, and thus remove the competition they pose to white merchants. Serving as the capstone to a streak of anti-Indian action by Durban, the bill is poised to further relegate the Natal Indians to the status of second-class citizens."
 NAT_establish_the_indian_council: "建立印度裔协会"
 NAT_establish_the_indian_council_desc: "Although relations between white settlers and Indians have rarely been good, our small state desperately needs to both make friends and bolster the economy as much as possible - as such, an olive branch must be extended to the Indians of Natal. The establishment of a permanent Indian Council should hopefully provide Indians with a voice in government to help address the issues they face."
 NAT_abolish_indian_pass_laws: "废除印度裔通行证法"
 NAT_abolish_indian_pass_laws_desc: "Although white businesses complain about Indians moving in and outcompeting them, is this not simply the free market at work? Competition breeds success, and our young nation needs all the success it can get its hands on. Several pass laws restrict Indians from entering and doing business in certain parts of the country - it's time that we recognise their existence as arbitrary and allow entrepreneurship to flourish."
 NAT_indian_representation_in_parliament: "议会中的印度裔代表"
 NAT_indian_representation_in_parliament_desc: "It is a natural right of all people to be represented in some form of government, something that has not been afforded to the Indians of Natal for some time. Although there have been some difficulties smoothing over relations, and the white settler population is always hesitant to share power with others, the Indians ultimately represent a small enough share of the population that having representation in Parliament can finally be considered."
 NAT_open_higher_education_to_indians: "向印度裔开放高等教育"
 NAT_open_higher_education_to_indians_desc: "Much like South Africa, almost every major institution in Natal is segregated in some way, and education is no difference. The university system in most of the country is barred to non-whites, a truth that deprives many Indians of valuable opportunities and keeps them gated from paths to social mobility. Now that we've been working to better integrate Indians into Natal, it's time that we began to open the gates."
 NAT_nation_building: "建立国家"
 NAT_nation_building_desc: "Ours is a fledgling nation, a province that was never supposed to be independent but has been forced into being so by its circumstances. As it seems that South Africa will not return to the Crown any time soon, we must learn to bear the burden of nation building - Natal must learn to ring true if she is to last for long."
 NAT_pass_the_natal_constitution_act: "通过纳塔尔宪法案"
 NAT_pass_the_natal_constitution_act_desc: "Natal has gone from having the status of a province of another body to having the rights and duties to match that of a Dominion. One of these duties is to uphold the British legacy of responsible government and the rule of law - and now that Natal has been severed from South Africa, there is something of a void at the highest level of the legal system. It is time for us to write a constitution, as other Dominions have done."
 NAT_welcome_the_anglo_south_african_influx: "欢迎英国移民涌入"
 NAT_welcome_the_anglo_south_african_influx_desc: "Natal is a proudly British state - the white settler population here is overwhelmingly of British descent, as opposed to the Dutch Afrikaners present in the rest of South Africa. With the war's conclusion, there are several loyal British subjects who are now ruled by a tyrannical Afrikaner regime. It is our duty to allow these people to return to the Crown's patronage."
 NAT_scrap_dutch_administration: "废除荷兰语"
 NAT_scrap_dutch_administration_desc: "One of the remaining legacies of our previous membership in the Union of South Africa is the persisting use of Dutch in some corners of government, as was required of us to accommodate the Afrikaners. However, as we are no longer sharing power with Afrikaners, then what use is there for maintaining the status of Dutch? It would be easier and more productive to change all arms of government to one language - English."
 NAT_herald_the_natal_briton_identity: "拥抱纳塔尔的英国认同"
 NAT_herald_the_natal_briton_identity_desc: "阿非利卡人自认是布尔共和国的继承者，以反抗英国为荣。我们不然，我们是大英帝国自豪的自治领，是英王陛下在这孤独海角的卫兵。我们的命运同帝国绑定，誓与帝国共生死！"
 NAT_reform_the_division_into_supreme_court: "改省法院为最高法院"
 NAT_reform_the_division_into_supreme_court_desc: "Now that Natal will go on on its own, we must reform the provincial division which previously was the highest provincial court in the land, into a genuine Supreme Court which will decide the fate of Natal's legal issues once and for all. This should resolve the final legal issues brought by our independence."
 NAT_separate_the_natal_police: "分离纳塔尔警务部门"
 NAT_separate_the_natal_police_desc: "Going alone at it means that the Natal Police will have to be separated from the South African Police, as we can no longer rely on the instructions from Pretoria. The Natal Police Force shall henceforth be responsible to the Dominion government, and will be directed in accordance to its needs only."
 NAT_seek_imperial_support: "寻求大英帝国支持"
 NAT_seek_imperial_support_desc: "The imperial government in Canada is much needed to help to continue to build our new nation, and to turn it into the Entente's new outpost in the Cape. Entente resources have already been made available to us during the Third Boer War - all we need to do is ask."
 NAT_national_reconstruction: "国家重建"
 NAT_national_reconstruction_desc: "Natal has been torn apart by war. Now that the cannons have ceased, it is our national responsibility to bring back Natal to its pre-war prosperity - no small feat after a civil war that will likely define a generation. Even so, Natal shall rise to the occasion."
 NAT_redirect_iedc_funds: "重新分配帝国经发委资金"
 NAT_redirect_iedc_funds_desc: "IEDC funds for the Union of South Africa had already been approved when the war broke out. Of course, Natal is significantly smaller than South Africa, but on the other hand, we have been devastated by war as well. Let us petition the IEDC to redirect its planned funds to us instead, now that South Africa so narrow-mindedly decided to follow its own path."
 NAT_found_central_bank: "建立中央银行"
 NAT_found_central_bank_desc: "我们不能继续使用南非货币了：那会使我们依赖于南非并损害我们独立且忠于英帝国的形象。为此我们必须首先建立一个中央银行机构。"
 NAT_issue_natal_pound: "引入纳塔尔镑"
 NAT_issue_natal_pound_desc: "随着中央银行的建立，是时候用纳塔尔自己的货币取代南非货币了。我们不会再服从比勒陀利亚的货币政策，经济独立将宣告我们的国家和政治独立。"
 NAT_invest_in_natal_unicollege: "投资纳塔尔大学学院"
 NAT_invest_in_natal_unicollege_desc: "The Natal University college is the largest public place for education in the nation, but it still struggles to match the likes of the Stellensbosch and the Witwatersrand. Let us invest in it to ensure our research capacity remains properly up to speed..."
 NAT_encourage_cash_cropping: "Encourage Cash Crop Farming"
 NAT_encourage_cash_cropping_desc: "Cash crop farming has been found to be extremely profitable all over the world, and the climate of Natal is very amenable to the cultivation of cotton, citrus, and bananas. Should these industries be expanded, the nation will see its profits go through the roof - we have a duty to see that our young state becomes a prosperous one."
 NAT_expand_durban_port: "扩建德班港"
 NAT_expand_durban_port_desc: "The Port of Durban is already one of the busiest ports in Africa, and now that we enjoy favourable trading terms with our fellow Entente states, it is poised to be a leading exporter of goods from the region to other Entente economies - which isn't to mention the new strategic duties placed on the port. An expansion of the port is most certainly in order."
 NAT_durban_shipyards: "德班船坞"
 NAT_durban_shipyards_desc: "While we already have something of a domestic shipbuilding industry, it was merely a part of the greater South African one. As we, of course, are now separated from the shipyards of Cape Town, our duties to the Entente have increased - and our shipyards shall increase to match."
 NAT_trade_with_empire: "帝国贸易"
 NAT_trade_with_empire_desc: "Trade is the lifeblood of such a small state as ours. Luckily, we are in a prime position to enjoy preferred trade status with our peers in the Empire, and obtain much-needed contracts for both import and export. We merely have to reach out to the other Dominions and make a deal."
 NAT_improve_train_lines: "Improve the Train Lines"
 NAT_improve_train_lines_desc: "While Natal is a small state, she is one with great ambitions of an industrial economy, something that is simply not possible without modern and efficient railways. Much of our rail network was designed to be oriented around the greater South African one, something that must also be rectified"
 NAT_expand_newcastle_sp: "Expand Newcastle's Steel Mills"
 NAT_expand_newcastle_sp_desc: "Newcastle is the largest steel-producing region in Natal by quite a margin, and the industry dominates a large part of the local economy. While previously, it had to contend with competition from other mills in South Africa, Newcastle now has the undivided attention of both Durban and the Entente at large - and with this comes a flow of investment to help it meet its new obligations."
 NAT_newcastle_development: "Develop Newcastle's Industry"
 NAT_newcastle_development_desc: "With the early steel expansion efforts starting to produce profits, we can begin to reinvest these gains into other industries. Newcastle has the capacity to sustain other ventures that could serve to not just diversify the economy, but also serve as the foundation for domestic military industry - something that seems increasingly to be a necessity."
 NAT_found_nbc: "成立纳塔尔广播公司"
 NAT_found_nbc_desc: "With South Africa gone, the South African Broadcasting Company is no longer applicable to Natal either. It would be irresponsible for us to simply let our radio infrastructure wither on the vine - the national interests obligates that we build our own national radio broadcasting corporation which will serve as the voice of the government towards the people."
 NAT_mozambique_trade: "Trade with Mozambique"
 NAT_mozambique_trade_desc: "The Portuguese colony of Mozambique has always been important to Natal - Natalian industries have often imported valuable resources from our neighbour, and used them to make manufactured goods for export. While this relationship was disrupted by war for some time, now that we enjoy a period of peace, we can take steps to reintegrate our regional economies."
 NAT_two_can_play_the_game: "Two Can Play the Game"
 NAT_two_can_play_the_game_desc: "For the longest time the Boers have remained convinced that have held the upper hand by utilising irregular warfare to their advantage. But they have made one fatal error, we Natalese know our land just as well and are just as capable in the tactics of deception and subterfuge. After all, two can play the game."
 NAT_phase_in_new_standard_equipment: "Phase in New Standard Equipment"
 NAT_phase_in_new_standard_equipment_desc: "Natal must obtain the latest Entente rifle models and production licences, in order to ensure a level of standardisation and thus lessening the burden on supply chains. Unified equipment standards can help ensure uniform training regiments and more efficient fighting."
 NAT_entente_instructors: "引进协约国顾问"
 NAT_entente_instructors_desc: "While we have many patriotic veterans wishing to help train up future generations of soldiers at our disposal, it wouldn't hurt to keep abreast of current warfare developments by working with our Entente allies."
 NAT_establish_nsis: "设立纳塔尔秘密情报处"
 NAT_establish_nsis_desc: "Cryptology, espionage and secrecy have always been defining elements of warfare but Natal is lagging behind in this department. We must form our own espionage division, the Natalese Secret Intelligence Service, to combat those who would do us harm."
 NAT_Zulu_Question: "祖鲁问题"
 NAT_Zulu_Question_desc: "In the realm of military affairs, Natal faces a problem - its military remains segregated in favour of the white minority, reducing its already small manpower pool to nigh dismal levels. While the white-led government has always been nervous about giving the natives arms, for several reasons - a little bending of the rules can be made to end this problem. Needs must when the devil drives."
 NAT_royal_natalese_army: "纳塔尔皇家陆军"
 NAT_royal_natalese_army_desc: "Bestowed on us by the King himself, the Natalese Royal Army will form the independent ground forces operating in defence of responsible rule in South Africa. With increased coordination and concentration, our planning capabilities should be much stronger."
 NAT_fullerite_doctrine: "Incorporate Fullerite Doctrine"
 NAT_fullerite_doctrine_desc: "J.F.C. 'Boney' Fuller is one of Canada's leading tank theorists and while his ideas are a bit...interesting, his work on armoured warfare is incredibly fitting for the long stretches of savanna and other flat locales that make up Southern Africa."
 NAT_durban_light_infantry: "The Durban Light Infantry"
 NAT_durban_light_infantry_desc: "One of the most senior units in the old South African army, the Royal Durban Light Infantry have long served with distinction and pride. By properly incorporating their legacy and allowing them to train other units in the methods of light and swift warfare, we can create a capable and quick ground force division."
 NAT_salvage_ac_designs: "Marmon-Herrington Designs"
 NAT_salvage_ac_designs_desc: "Marmon-Herrington was the foremost designer and producer of armoured cars and motorised equipment for our South African predecessors. We can salvage some prototype designs that have been left behind for incorporation into our own motorised divisions."
 NAT_extend_army_motorisation: "Extend Army Motorisation Contracts"
 NAT_extend_army_motorisation_desc: "As our army begins to take shape, it is becoming apparent that we will need help for our ambitious motorisation plans. Where holes need to be plugged, private companies can take up contracts to manufacture trucks on our behalf."
 NAT_commission_tank_designs: "Commission Tank Designs"
 NAT_commission_tank_designs_desc: "Lacking our own designs to salvage, we'll need to license and commission new tank prototypes for our budding armoured corps. Canada would be most helpful here but we can't rely on their charity forever."
 NAT_armoured_warfare_formations: "Armoured Warfare Formations"
 NAT_armoured_warfare_formations_desc: "We need to properly incorporate the use of armoured fighting vehicles, be they mechanised infantry or big old tanks, into our fighting capabilities. Large armoured formations will be the vanguard of our army."
 NAT_guarding_overhead: "Guarding Overhead"
 NAT_guarding_overhead_desc: "The fledgling Royal Natal Air Force must be reorganised so that it's primary purpose is to support troops on the ground and disrupt enemy operations. That way we can totally sabotage any opposition in our path."
 NAT_ground_targeting: "Ground Targeting Training"
 NAT_ground_targeting_desc: "In supporting our troops we cannot just bomb an area indiscriminately and hope for the best. Our pilots must be trained to be able to hit precision targets from high altitudes. An incredible task, but not an unachievable feat..."
 NAT_red_soil_white_sky: "Red Soil Under a White Sky"
 NAT_red_soil_white_sky_desc: "To achieve total ground-air synchronisation is no simple feat, but in doing so we will vanquish our enemies like never before. The soil will be stained red, under a sky filled with white smoke."
 NAT_bureau_of_military_munitions: "The Bureau for Munitions & Labour"
 NAT_bureau_of_military_munitions_desc: "With the engines of war ramping up, we will need to establish a proper service to coordinate the internal production and acquisition of munitions as well as the native labour corps. We should look to mobilise the latter into servie of new arms plants."
 NAT_lease_entente_fighters: "Lease Entente Fighter Designs"
 NAT_lease_entente_fighters_desc: "Aerial dogfighting and escorting is the bread and butter for the RNAF but currently we lack native designs to form the basis of our fighter wing. With some assisstance from Canada we can put this right."
 NAT_war_in_the_bush: "War in the Bush"
 NAT_war_in_the_bush_desc: "Much of Africa is dense forest, jungle and bush. With Natal forming the imperial vanguard in protecting the colonies, we must prepare our troops for the eventuality we are forced to fight in such inhospitable terrain."
 NAT_askari_guides: "Incorporate Askari Scouts"
 NAT_askari_guides_desc: "Askari soldiers have long been a loyal element of our forces, and they know their homelands very well. By properly incorporate local scouts we can have a large corps of capable reconnaissance experts at our disposal."
 NAT_masters_of_the_irregular: "Masters of the Irregular"
 NAT_masters_of_the_irregular_desc: "Like our Boer adversaries, we too know how to use the land to our advantage and how to leverage an arsenal of skilled men over an army of grunts. What we may lack in firepower and raw recruits, we can more than make up for in skill, cunning and guile."
 NAT_savanna_paras: "Training on the Savanna"
 NAT_savanna_paras_desc: "While our climate is more akin to the temperate Mediterranean than tropical jungles of the Congo, military exercises in the heat do not exactly lend themselves to good health. By utilising the savanna for long training exercises, we can ensure our soldiers are able to deal with more difficult climates."
 NAT_savanna_marines: "Training on the Savanna"
 NAT_savanna_marines_desc: "While our climate is more akin to the temperate Mediterranean than tropical jungles of the Congo, military exercises in the heat do not exactly lend themselves to good health. By utilising the savanna for long training exercises, we can ensure our soldiers are able to deal with more difficult climates."
 NAT_carbineers_paras: "Expand the Natal Carbineers"
 NAT_carbineers_paras_desc: "Having served with distinction, the Royal Natal Carbineers are an old force in the South African army, having earned a reputation of being fearsome warriors. By expanding the numbers of the Carbineers, we can impart some new tactics to the rest of the army and new recruits eager to prove their mettle."
 NAT_carbineers_marines: "Expand the Natal Carbineers"
 NAT_carbineers_marines_desc: "Having served with distinction, the Royal Natal Carbineers are an old force in the South African army, having earned a reputation of being fearsome warriors.

 NAT_natal_bomber_division: "Form the Natal Bomber Division"
 NAT_natal_bomber_division_desc: "With a focus on a smaller and more elite army, kitted out for special operations, the Royal Natalese Air Force will become our main fighting force, focusing on total destruction of the enemy via way of extreme destruction and tactical airpower."
 NAT_saturated_destruction_exercises: "Saturated Destruction Exercises"
 NAT_saturated_destruction_exercises_desc: "With our army operating on a more smaller scale, we can afford to be far more aggressive with our bombing runs. Rather than leave anything to chance, large areas of military interest will be attacked and saturated with a rain of hellfire."
 NAT_night_fighting: "By the Veil of Darkness"
 NAT_night_fighting_desc: "Daytime air assaults are a dangerous game, leaving our pilots open to attack but at the same time giving them the visibility they so desparately need. Night operations are risky but with adequate training we can counter this to a degree."
 NAT_natalese_parachute_corps: "The Natalese Parachute Corps"
 NAT_natalese_parachute_corps_desc: "With our army moving to focus on elite troops and specialist operations, we should invest in keeping the old South African 'commando' tradition alive while making them fit for the modern age. Death from above need not come in the form of a bomb, but a regiment of highly trained warriors too."
 NAT_evasion_adaption_survival: "Evasion, Adaption & Survival"
 NAT_evasion_adaption_survival_desc: "Being dropped deep behind enemy lines is a dangerous task and our parachutists must be armed with the tools necessary to ensure their immediate survival, ability to evade enemy forces and adapt to circumstances so they may live to fight another day."
 NAT_rapid_envelopment_doctrine: "Rapid Envelopment Doctrine"
 NAT_rapid_envelopment_doctrine_desc: "Our commandoes will need to be quick and able to rapidly organise themselves on the ground. In doing they'll be able to quickly launch a vertical envelopement and respond to threats."
 NAT_marines: "The Natalese Maritime Regiments"
 NAT_marines_desc: "Being a coastal nation, borne of maritime tradition, it is only natural that we take our backs to the sea and learn to fight from the waves. With our enemies protected by the deep blue ocean, we should show them this is no protection at all."
 NAT_amphibious_landing_exercises: "Amphibious Landing Exercises"
 NAT_amphibious_landing_exercises_desc: "Our troops must be able to efficiently and swiftly launch from the sea to shore and secure a beach-head in rapid succession. It's no easy task but with adequate training, any challenge is surmountable."
 NAT_commando_exercises: "Naval Commando Exercises"
 NAT_commando_exercises_desc: "While our marines will be the first troops to land and establish a beach-head, they will need to survive the initial onslaught, likely while lacking proper supply lines and be forced to push against enemy forces. It is imperative they receive the proper training to survive this initial onslaught."
 NAT_royal_natalese_navy: "Form the Royal Natalese Navy"
 NAT_royal_natalese_navy_desc: "Though coming from more than humble origins, the newly christened Royal Natal Navy has come into its own. Though not a large Navy by any means, it can still provide South Africa's original goal of defending the Cape against any who threat the Entente and Natal's interests."
 NAT_expand_durban_dockyards: "Expand the Durban Dockyards"
 NAT_expand_durban_dockyards_desc: "With more or less the entire South African Fleet changing colours to hoist the Union Jack over the Prinsenvlag, Natal has been left with a fairly large fleet for its size, but she lacks the facilities to maintain them. We will need to expand our dockyards to ensure we can properly support the one true navy."
 NAT_nipper_warfare: "'Nipper' Warfare"
 NAT_nipper_warfare_desc: "Destroyers are cheap, quick and reliable. Ideal ships for a coast guard and protecting their larger cousins, if weak. A large fleet of destroyers will form ideal 'nippers' to harass enemy ships and make way for our own."
 NAT_manoeuvre_exercises: "Manoeuvre Exercises"
 NAT_manoeuvre_exercises_desc: "The seas are large and our naval forces small. If they want to live to fight another day then they must be swift and quick, able to disappear into the night at a moment's notice and paralyse our enemies with quick manoeuvre skills."
 NAT_shipping_escorts: "Shipping Escorts"
 NAT_shipping_escorts_desc: "Cruisers make for excellent mini-capital ships, are swift and versatile and will be form the backbone of the forces protecting vital shipping routes. After all, we can't let Natal be isolated from the King!"
 NAT_sailing_the_cape: "Sailing the Cape"
 NAT_sailing_the_cape_desc: "Operating near large bodies of water, our naval forces are somewhat isolated from our allies and so we will need to prepare for long-distance voyages. Sailing the cape and learning how to maximise our supplies will ensure this becomes a capability."

 NAT_halifax_at_the_helm_desc: "With Admiral Halifax defecting to Natal in its time of need, he has taken the helm of the Natal's Navy and is helping direct our fledgling forces. Soon enough we shall be a force to be reckoned with!"

 natal.18.d: "前纳塔尔省，现在的纳塔尔自治领，不仅仅是南非流散英裔的核心地区：在同一块土地上，传奇的祖鲁人战士沙卡建立了祖鲁王国，直到1871年在英国-祖鲁战争中被不断扩张的大英帝国击败。\n\n由于这个历史背景，直到今天构成纳塔尔大部分人口的土著居民是祖鲁人。和南非一样我们是以少数的白人来进行统治的——和过去的纳塔尔省、纳塔尔殖民地一样。现在纳塔尔离开了南非实现了完全自治，新政府有必要重新审视祖鲁人的状况。"

 natal.22.t: "纳塔尔的印度裔"
 natal.22.d: "纳塔尔的亚裔人口主要是甘蔗种植园印度裔契约移民工人的后代。现在，他们已经占据了纳塔尔人口相当部分，甚至超过了白人流散族裔的数量。更让白人恼怒的是，这些印度裔中很多是成功的小生意人，在商业竞争中击败了白人。因此，纳塔尔的白人早就限制了印度裔的公民权，甚至比南非联邦整体作出这种限制更早。\n\n亚裔人群政治上觉醒了，歧视他们可能导致大规模反抗。然而，如果我们要接受他们也得小心，白人选民可能会不满。随着纳塔尔的独立实现了，需要选择针对印度裔纳塔尔公民的政策。"

 natal.25.t: "[GetYear]年大选"
 natal.25.d: "随着宪法正式确立下来，纳塔尔的人民（白人）是时候选举一个代议制政府了。独立战争时联合联邦党与自治领党的临时联盟解体了，之前几周两党在进行激烈的竞选。很多人期待两党中的一个赢得50%以上多数票，但如果最终结果是一个悬浮议会，纳塔尔工党和南非党的残余将有小概率成功组成一个政府，把两个大党打到反对党的位置。国民党也毫不掩饰地以同南非合并的纲领竞选，但他们除了在德班北部以外都没什么竞争力。"

 natal.27.t: "[GetYear]年联邦选举"
 natal.27.d: "现在是时候举办我们新生联邦的第一次大选了。就像旧南非联邦一样，绝大多数选民是白人，但有一点显著不同：很多阿非利卡人由于与南非国民党叛逆有联系，或干脆就在上次布尔战争中与我们为敌，而被剥夺选举权。因此相对阿非利卡人英裔南非居民有明显优势。\n\n这次选举的情况有些类似南非联邦早期的选举，尼科尔斯的联合联邦党扮演了英裔联盟代表的角色。而现在由扬·亨德里克·霍夫迈尔接替了史末资将军领导的南非党则受阿非利卡人支持，尽管党内大多数逃脱了剥夺政治权力处分的前南非国民党人并没有意识到霍夫迈尔正将党领上自由主义的路线。"

 natal.53.d: "现在J·H·霍夫迈尔的党在开普敦新组建的联邦议会中拥有多数席位，他抛出了一份很受争议的提案。法案很可能通过：霍夫迈尔在选举中，把希望押注在那些温和右翼阿非利卡人，他们自己的党因为支持南非从大英帝国分离而被禁止了，但他们也不会愿意投票给希顿·尼科尔斯领导的英裔联合联邦党。因此霍夫迈尔在他权限内尽最大努力提名进步派候选人。这样，他创造了一个阿非利卡人和英裔进步派的联盟，尽管通过操纵选区划分手段导致英裔票更有决定性，霍夫迈尔还是击败了联合联邦党。\n\n联合联邦党看着南非党胜选的结果，又不愿意对有色人种投票权问题明确表态，只好决定支持法案，同时悄悄告诉自己的纳塔尔选民法案是给印度裔授予投票权的第一步。联邦议会中唯一反对法案的是强硬派种族分离主义者的自治党，斯塔拉德上校谴责总理的提案，称：“新生的南非联邦各州，不会像南非联邦下的省那样，乖乖听比勒陀利亚的话。这份法案僭越了联邦的权限。”然而他的反对阻止不了法案通过，自治党只是议会中的一个小党。"
 natal.53.a: "法案轻松通过"
 natal.54.t: "斯泰伦博斯的语言战争"
 natal.54.d: "我们花了大力气把南非英化，其中一个举措是要求高等教育机构废除南非荷兰语教学改用英语。不幸的是，南非最古老并富有盛名的斯泰伦博斯大学为长期使用南非荷兰语进行教学的传统而自豪。尽管我们做了种种努力：引入亲英的教职员工、为服从我们的大学提供资助、对不服从的大学削减经费。斯泰伦博斯大学仍然坚持雇佣阿非利卡人教授，继续在大部分课程中使用南非荷兰语。看来他们将是一个我们无法撼动的阿非利卡文化孤岛。"
 natal.54.a: "够了，教英语，或者变成历史书上的几行字！"
 natal.54.b: "取消特权并撤销经费资助！"
 natal.55.t: "南非的战争和反攻归乡计划"
 natal.55.d.default: "欧洲正处于战争中，[Root.GetNameDef]第一优先的任务是从哪些不信神的工团主义者手中夺回家乡群岛。然而不幸的是，我们的部队仍然被困在非洲南部大草原同[SAF.GetNameDef]作战。尽管丢掉有重要战略意义的好望角会是令人不快的，但我们政府中大多数人同意我们还是应该以反攻计划为先，南非可以以后再说。我们已经向南非方面提议恢复战前的状态，具体说就是：纳塔尔和南罗得西亚可以重返帝国，而南非其他部分则将完全独立并得到我们承认……至少现在是这样……"
 natal.55.d.losing: "Natal has capitulated, ENT wants out ASAP - will abandon Rhodesia if it still exists. TODO_SAF"
 natal.55.a: "同布尔人联系，争取讲和。"
 natal.55.b: "他们就快不行了，我们可以两方面兼顾。"
 natal.56.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]求和"
 natal.56.d.default: "[From.GetAdjective]政府通过德国中介联系了我们：他们希望回到战前的现状并承认我们的共和国，但我们必须承认纳塔尔和南罗得西亚的独立，也就是说彻底失去这两个省份。很明显他们仍然认为可以最终击败我们，但考虑到他们急切地希望反攻回英伦群岛，他们认为不值得再投入兵力和装备了。政府中有些人认为我们应该接受这个安排，这意味着我们终于获得了独立，和他们继续作战下去是没有希望的。另外有些人我们可以彻底打赢这场战争，把英国佬彻底从非洲大陆赶下海将保障我们的国家长治久安。"
 natal.56.d.winning: "Natal has capitulated, ENT wants out ASAP - will abandon Rhodesia if it still exists. TODO_SAF"
 natal.56.a: "现实的说，这是我们能期待的最好结果了。"
 natal.56.b: "如果需要，我们将把所有英国佬赶出我们的非洲大陆！"
 natal.57.t: "共和国同意了！"
 natal.57.d: "南非共和国接受了我们的和平提议。南非共和国将成为独立国家，但至少英裔为主的纳塔尔和南罗得西亚不会被布尔人统治。很多人会不满这个结果，特别是那些在南非其他地区居住的成为了少数族裔的英裔，但至少我们可以专注于反攻本岛了。"
 natal.57.a: "下一站，不列颠尼亚！"
 natal.58.t: "共和国拒绝议和！"
 natal.58.d: "愚蠢的布尔人拒绝了我们提供的让他们独立的橄榄枝，坚持南非要以所有的省份统一地独立，纳塔尔和罗得西亚人的意愿被踩在脚下。显然他们认为可以迫使我们接受他们的条件。"
 natal.58.a: "你们自寻死路，荷兰佬……"
 natal.59.t: "[ENT.GetNameDefCap]和[SAF.GetNameDef]签署和平协议"
 natal.59.d: "为了集中精力反攻本岛，[ENT.GetAdjective]政府决定和南非人签订和平协议。他们保障了我们的独立，但他们也接受了南非的独立，这意味着之前在纳塔尔讨论过的南非联邦什么的都胎死腹中了。"
 natal.59.a: "就这样吧……"
 natal.60.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]想要加入协约国"
 natal.60.d: "当时我们拒绝帮助南非内部的亲英反叛势力，几乎没人认为他们能承受住打击并独自击败南非共和国。然后他们真的靠自己逆袭了，现在，[From.GetNameDefCap]再次正式申请加入大英帝国及帝国势力范围。眼下好像没有理由拒绝他们……"
 natal.60.a: "让米字旗再次高高飘扬！"
 natal.60.b: "干得好，但问题在于就是要甩掉南非！"
 natal.61.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]同意了"
 natal.61.d: "不出意料，[From.GetNameDef]这次非常乐意接纳我们。随着布尔人被击败，[Root.GetNameDef]矗立在南非，希望今后我们能和协约国永远在一起下去。"
 natal.61.a: "来，布尔佬，和我一起说：天～佑～吾～王！"
 natal.62.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap]又拒绝了我们！"
 natal.62.d: "真不敢相信！[From.GetAdjective]先是在我们和布尔疯子的战争中冷血旁观。他们认为我们毫无希望所以不愿出手，尽管如此我们还是凭着对帝国的忠诚竭尽全力打赢了，指望胜利后可以重新加入帝国。不幸的是，不知道什么原因帝国就是不想要我们。我们曾经除了忠诚一无所有，他们就这么报答我们吗？！"
 natal.62.a: "那就跟美国人混吧！"
