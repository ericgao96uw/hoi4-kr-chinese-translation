 TUR_deal_with_ohf_leaders_desc: "奥斯曼人民党的主要人物统治着国家，像伊斯麦特帕夏和费夫齐帕夏这样的家伙仍然遵循凯末尔派理念，并试图继续实施穆斯塔法·凯末尔帕夏的改革。要以叛国罪和危害国家罪将他们逮捕，就可以趁他们来不及反应制止他们。"

 TUR_purge_the_military_desc: "费夫齐帕夏和其他将军被逮捕的时候，许多士兵和士官作乱，从而暴露了他们与奥斯曼人民党的牵连。此党在军队树大根深，这显而易见，但我们不知道他们竟然有能力颠覆我们的政变。我们需要……除掉……所有对某些政党忠诚高于对军队忠诚的家伙。"

 TUR_reestablish_democrat_plurality_desc: "自从针对穆斯塔法·凯末尔帕夏的未遂刺杀事件以来，帝国几乎成为了奥斯曼人民党独大的独裁政权。然而，尽管议会仍然在被解散状态，我们还是必须为各派系提供一个自由结党与表态他们意愿的平台。"
 TUR_reestablish_millet_system: "重建米利特制度"
 TUR_reestablish_millet_system_desc: "米利特制度允许其他宗教的信徒聚居区拥有一定的自治权，不收到穆斯林正信徒的歧视。这意味着他们在面对法律时享有一定特权。虽然从大众的意见来看，这有违法律面前人人平等的原则，但这个制度尊重保护了个人的信仰自由。"
 TUR_revert_laws_on_secularism: "撤销世俗化法律"
 TUR_revert_laws_on_secularism_desc: "人民党为了所谓的世俗化出台了一大堆法案。很多人都认为这些法案构成了对伊斯兰教、哈里发本人乃至传统国教制度的攻击，而另一些人则认为这些法案暴力打击了无辜的宗教机构和苏菲派组织。现在，是时候取消这些倒行逆施的法案，来获得传统主义者的支持。"

 TUR_a_free_economy: "自由经济"
 TUR_a_free_economy_desc: "如今，帝国的疆界只局限于安纳托利亚，帝国最精华的部分已不在我们的统治之中。也许我们需要引入自由经济的政策和竞争性的商业法律，让帝国向世界市场开放，允许土耳其人民在世界舞台上一展他们的才华。"
 TUR_reorganize_ottoman_military: "重组奥斯曼军事"
 TUR_reorganize_ottoman_military_desc: "奥斯曼军队如今失败主义横行。就算我们勉强打赢了上一次世界大战，但自本世纪以来，我们的军队一直处于崩溃的边缘。很多将军都把军队视作帝国统治最大的短板，他们面对阿拉伯叛军的无力再度证明了这一点。我们必须对军队进行从上到下的彻底重组。"
 TUR_liberal_majority: "自由派多数"
 TUR_liberal_majority_desc: "萨巴哈丁亲王和他民主主义盟友卡齐姆·卡拉贝基尔领导下的奥斯曼救赎党自由派不像保守派一样反对阿塔图尔克的改革。他们认为帝国需要转向进步主义，但前提是民主政体。他们主张赋予妇女投票权和构建公共学校体系。"

 TUR_promote_political_sociology_desc: "萨巴哈丁亲王是埃米尔·涂尔干的忠实信者。涂尔干是社会学之父，专门研究人、人际关系和社会。亲王希望将这套科学引进帝国，教化百姓，并让统治者更了解奥斯曼社会。"

 TUR_universal_suffrage_desc: "普选是各大现代民主政体为之奋斗的目标。经过多轮选举权扩张，很多人认为是时候实现全民普选了。这一激进改革可能惹怒联合政府中的保守派，但也能赢得进步派和先前奥斯曼人民党党员的支持。"
 TUR_equality_before_the_law: "法律面前人人平等"
 TUR_equality_before_the_law_desc: "尽管奥斯曼宪法规定，无论宗教或种族，所有奥斯曼公民在法律面前人人平等，但帝国仍然严重偏袒人数占优的穆斯林，在奥斯曼的官僚系统的各个部门中，他们的权利得到了更好的保护和满足。以伊斯兰教法为基础的梅杰勒法是导致这一切的支柱，如果要实现真正的平等，大刀阔斧的改革就必不可少。"

 TUR_financial_assistance_for_the_anatolian_farmers_desc: "进来多轮战乱和灾害毁了多场收割。农民们不得不背井离乡，逃离战争。我们不能忘记卡拉贝基尔能获胜很大程度上依赖的这些贫农的选票。我们有义务帮助他们，恢复帝国战前繁荣的农耕经济。"

 TUR_redistribute_the_lands_desc: "虽然奥斯曼帝国在十九世纪引入了土地私有制的思想，并进行了土地再分配，但帝国的大部分土地仍然属国有或者皇室所有。私有土地的匮乏导致了生产效率的低下，而人们由于缺乏工作的动力，最终导致了专制的盛行。正如自由主义者们相信人无自由不立一样，我们必须向私人开放这些土地。"
 TUR_increase_people_politization: "群众的政治化"
 TUR_increase_people_politization_desc: "仅仅宣布国家走向民主是不够的！正如卡齐姆·卡拉贝基尔所断言的那样，现状是民主只属于精英，他们至少有最低限度的政治知识，会去投票，而大众和文盲阶层则对政治不感兴趣。为了纠正这一现状，我们很有必要开展规模庞大的运动，以图教人们去选举，像他们解释各党派的改革措施和观点。"

 TUR_more_power_to_the_meclis_i_mebusan_desc: "众议院（Meclis-i Mebûsan）是民主机构，但在联合进步委员会和人民党执政期间，它被过度操纵了。现在它负责领导土耳其人们走向伟大，因此它应该拥有政府和苏丹之上的不可变易的权力。"

 OTT_revise_mecelle_code: "修订梅杰勒法"
 OTT_revise_mecelle_code_desc: "现用的奥斯曼民法典是坦志麦特改革时代的遗产。尽管它基于沙里亚，它仍然代表了帝国司法大幅现代化的步伐。我们应该改良现有的法典，增进少数族群的权益，建立世俗的司法体系，并确保上诉法院的大法官能代表帝国多元的文化。"
 TUR_restore_coranic_schools: "恢复古兰经学校"
 TUR_restore_coranic_schools_desc: "奥斯曼人民党私自关闭的宗教学校应该重新开放。事实上，奥斯曼人民，尤其是文盲群体，倾向于将宗教视为至高之物之一。因此我们可以推断，重设宗教学校将使这些人更放心地送孩子来上学，尽管一些自由派认为这种教育是迷信的。"
 TUR_give_back_the_goods_of_the_suffi_order: "恢复苏菲教团的财产"
 TUR_give_back_the_goods_of_the_suffi_order_desc: "以旋转舞步闻名的苏菲行者组成的拜克塔什和梅夫拉维教团可将他们的历史追溯至小亚细亚伊斯兰化的黎明。这些教团曾被奥斯曼人民党政府虐待镇压。现在，我们应该正视过去的错误，赔偿教团，并归还僧院等产业。"
 TUR_saving_tradition_into_democracy: "统一传统与民主"
 TUR_saving_tradition_into_democracy_desc: "伊斯兰一直是更替的宗教。上百年来，阿拉伯和突厥裔穆斯林学者不断推进科学探索。我们现在有必要奉行伊斯兰教，将民主政体合理化，这看起来不会太难，我们只需要为个别传统教条提供更开明的解释。"
 TUR_use_the_tarikats: "利用教团"
 TUR_use_the_tarikats_desc: "教团是帝国内为数不多的有组织的穆斯林机构之一，在威权时期，他们一直处于幕后。他们很大程度上是社会垂直流动的载体：事实上，下至普通农民，上至苏丹本人，都可以成为教团成员。此外，他们还扮演着教育角色和社会角色。我们可以通过让他们在各省生根发芽，利用他们达成政治和社会目的。"
 TUR_redistribute_the_zakat: "天课税捐再分配"
 TUR_redistribute_the_zakat_desc: "苏丹是国家和宗教领袖，穆斯林每年缴纳的用于慈善的天课税捐必须收归国家，然后再由国家成立再分配机构，与伊玛目和穆夫提合作，以符合伊斯兰美德的最佳方式分配财富。"

 TUR_more_power_to_the_sultan: "苏丹获得更多权力"
 TUR_more_power_to_the_sultan_desc: "厄梅尔苏丹和帝国的前几任苏丹都迥然不同：他既不像阿卜杜勒-迈吉德二世那样专制，也不像他的四位前任苏丹那样被傀儡或击败，他就像那些远古时代统治帝国的苏丹一样，是突厥苏丹的形象。在恢复民主、救帝国于水火后，这位富有魅力的苏丹必须在政治上和政府中发挥作用，这样他才能和谐地治理国家和宗教。"

 TUR_repeal_the_national_protection_law_desc: "保证自给自足是奥斯曼人民党经济政策的关键之一。但闭关锁国并没有给我国带来充分的发展。我们必须消除保护主义的余毒，以便更好的向全世界开放贸易。"
 TUR_protect_private_properties: "保护私有财产"
 TUR_protect_private_properties_desc: "With the nationalisations carried out by the state in recent decades and the flight of foreign investors during the Weltkrieg, the place of private property seems to be questioned. Let's reassure the investors by proving the stability of the Anatolian economy and by signing assurances on their investments. Even the smallest peasant should be assured that his business will remain his own."
 TUR_develop_the_major_trade_cities: "发展主要贸易城市"
 TUR_develop_the_major_trade_cities_desc: "现在的全球化是通过海上贸易进行的，而安纳托利亚位于地中海与黑海、东方与欧洲间的十字路口，我们有着十分优越的地理位置。许多来自亚洲的货物和资源都要经过我们的港口。此外，随着苏伊士运河落入埃及人手里，我们必须开始和埃及竞争。而这也给了我们个接近法国的大好机会。"
 TUR_a_priority_to_foreign_investments: "优待外国投资"
 TUR_a_priority_to_foreign_investments_desc: "一些外国公司考虑到我们的劳动力价格或气候，寻求搬迁至安纳托利亚，或者外包给我们。我们可以利用这些相对优势来发展和充实经济。"

 TUR_create_constantinople_board_desc: "Stock exchanges seem to be the new factor of exchange between companies and individuals.

 TUR_reinvigorate_the_turkish_coffee_culture: "重振土耳其咖啡文化"
 TUR_reinvigorate_the_turkish_coffee_culture_desc: "土耳其咖啡文化有国际公认，我们的历史也与之息息相关。我们可以利用传统咖啡的形象来发展“软实力”，同时将其推为欧洲贸易展销会所需的奢侈品。一些公司可以作为发展咖啡文化的基本。"
 TUR_world_class_coffee_exports: "世界级的咖啡出口"
 TUR_world_class_coffee_exports_desc: "Our endeavours to explore new markets and to bring the entire world the delight that is Turkish coffee have been successful thus far, and the demand for this traditional beverage is continuously increasing.

 TUR_learn_from_our_defeat: "吸取失败教训"
 TUR_learn_from_our_defeat_desc: "The war against the Cairo Pact was a failure, but some Turks even consider the Weltkrieg a failure. Despite some iconic victories at Çanakkale, Kut and Maraş, our troops were disorganised, and without German and Austrian help we would not have survived. Because we didn't learn from our mistakes, the empire was devastated by the Arabs. From now on, we must learn from our defeats to ensure victory."
 TUR_modernize_our_equipment: "士兵装备现代化"
 TUR_modernize_our_equipment_desc: "Equipment is the key to our army and the engine of our soldiers. The British General Allenby said \"Turkish soldiers are very brave, they love their homeland and they do not hesitate to give their lives for it if necessary\". Yet what good is bravery if it is in vain? By equipping our divisions with modern weapons and armoured vehicles, we can honour the soldiers who fell on the fields of the Caucasus and the Middle East."

 TUR_reform_the_gendarmerie: "改革奥斯曼帝国宪兵"
 TUR_reform_the_gendarmerie_desc: "The Ottoman Gendarmerie was reformed in 1913 by the CUP to combat bandits crossing Anatolia, making it a military police force.

 TUR_nationalise_ottoman_banks_desc: "Many of our national banks are owned by foreign capital, which puts them in subjective situations regarding our investment requests for projects that would be contrary to foreign economic interests.

 TUR_protect_national_economy_desc: "We can deal with the crisis that has hit our country in defeat by protecting it from foreign capital and refocusing the Turkish economy on itself.

 TUR_separation_of_state_and_church: "政教分离"
 TUR_separation_of_state_and_church_desc: "The first mandatory step of the Kemalist reforms was the separation of church and state. This idea dates back to the Enlightenment and has been implemented in a few states such as France. This principle of secularism in law establishes the religious neutrality of the state. In the Ottoman Empire, this issue was all the more delicate, as the head of state was also the head of Islam."

 TUR_ostentatious_signs_desc: "随便找个欧洲人都能认出土耳其人。我们的宗教要求我们佩戴明显的装饰，男人要戴非斯毡帽(fez)或包头巾(turban)，女人要戴希贾布头巾(hijab)或布卡罩袍(burqa)。然而，这些令人不适的衣服不应该继续作为一种义务。男人应该戴上有檐帽，保护自己不被太阳晒伤，或者只是为了看起来现代些；女人应该摘掉头巾罩袍，露出头发，别去戴令人喘不过气的面纱。可是，人民和机构准备好进行改革了吗？"
 TUR_protectionism: "保护主义"
 TUR_protectionism_desc: "比起走向简单的自给自足，我们要为市场和必要商品留下最低限度的空间。为此，我们可以对所有进口产品树立标准并实施配额，并针对那些对本地生产者来说竞争力过强的产品征税。"
 TUR_tariffs_on_foreign_goods: "征收国外商品关税"
 TUR_tariffs_on_foreign_goods_desc: "Finally, we can establish a permanent reform of taxes on foreign products. In addition, foreign companies that want to buy Turkish products will have to pay a fee. With a smaller nation we need to conserve resources."
 TUR_restriction_on_foreign_investment: "破坏自由贸易"
 TUR_restriction_on_foreign_investment_desc: "Still in a protectionist logic, it is time for the nation and its companies to focus on themselves and not on the lure of world trade. For this, the implementation of laws targeting our producers will be essential."
 TUR_nationalisation_question: "国有化困境"
 TUR_nationalisation_question_desc: "The question of our economic inclination has long been discussed and Kemal did not elaborate on the subject. An important part of the party thinks that if the Gazi wanted the establishment of a democratic republic based on European principles then this republic would have to accept to remain in a liberal economic mode. However, a minority wing of the OHF party called 'Kadro' believes that it is necessary to nationalise most of the economy for the nation's safety."
 TUR_classless_society: "无阶级化社会"
 TUR_classless_society_desc: "骨干派的党夺取了权力。在国有化问题上，党投票决定将对国家有用的大部分商品和生产资料国有化。在党内危机之后，大多数议员都投靠了骨干派。与凯末尔关系密切的极端派穆罕默德·雷杰普帕夏宣布土耳其社会避免了社会斗争，并呼吁建立起“无阶级化社会”的团结。"
 TUR_turkish_railway: "土耳其国家铁路"
 TUR_turkish_railway_desc: "Kemal was particularly fond of certain tools such as the telegraph or the train. For him, the latter made it possible to improve not only physical mobility in the country but also intellectual mobility by allowing the dissemination of ideas and the improvement of living conditions."
 TUR_turkish_man_myth: "土耳其人神话"
 TUR_turkish_man_myth_desc: "The Kadro paper, in its desire to unify the Turkish people, sometimes unaware of their unity, created a model Turkish man. Some people think they mean Mustafa Kemal or even Mehmet Recep Peker. In any case, their notion of the Turkish man is by definition the physical power for work and war but also the intellectual power, will and determination of the Turkish people."
 TUR_turkish_solidarism: "土耳其协作主义"
 TUR_turkish_solidarism_desc: "The idea of Turkish solidarism is said to come from the sociology of Emile Durkheim and his French solidarism. Regardless of its origin, it consists of the social accountability of each individual. A child is indebted to all his peers for what they have given him, be that education, values or knowledge. Thus, the Kadro movement bases its interpretation of society from a Marxist-Materialist point of view on the very principle of human relationships in order to analyse history."
 TUR_urban_rural_equality: "城乡平等"
 TUR_urban_rural_equality_desc: "Speaking of a classless society in reality, the only structural difference in the Turkish population is where they live, which greatly affects their aspirations, income and living conditions. They separate the urban and rural class, the latter being greatly divided. However, they call for the establishment of reforms to improve life in the countryside and achieve equality between these two populations."
 TUR_social_nationalism: "社会民族主义"
 TUR_social_nationalism_desc: "The social nationalism theorised by Aydemir consists in the total elimination of all forms of class dictatorship, whether proletarian or bourgeois. The term social exemplifies the socio-economic reforms that the party must implement, connected to the word national, which symbolises the Turkish revolution of the nation and the nationally integrated economy."
 TUR_merge_the_banks: "建立中央银行"
 TUR_merge_the_banks_desc: "The Turkish central bank will make it possible to fix the interest rates of the banks and thus to regulate monetary creation but also to protect the state in the event of a crisis in the international markets. Thanks to the law of supply and demand and its control over the banks within our borders we will be able to reduce the high inflation rate in Turkey."
 TUR_subside_turkish_textile_companies: "补贴土耳其纺织公司"
 TUR_subside_turkish_textile_companies_desc: "By offering to subsidise textile companies in the Constantinople and Bursa regions, we will improve our comparative advantages, which will in turn increase both our growth and exports. We are limiting foreign competition, but for this we need to improve our own production systems."
 TUR_waive_the_ottomans_debts: "拒偿奥斯曼债务"
 TUR_waive_the_ottomans_debts_desc: "自19世纪以来，帝国一直负担着沉重的债务，尤其是对欧洲各银行和机构的债务。不过，我们现在是一个拥有新政治制度和新身份认同的新国家，不可能为过去苏丹的错误买单，就算拒绝偿还这些债务会降低我们的国际形象又怎样？"
 TUR_Iraqi_question: "伊拉克问题"
 TUR_Iraqi_question_desc: "Currently, we stand alone and isolated among the countries of the Middle East. While many of our neighbouring nations still hold a grudge against us, the newborn state of Iraq is different and has a relatively friendly attitude towards us, mainly because the region of Iraq was thoroughly developed and cared about by the Porte. Maybe we should try to find some new friends in the lands of Mesopotamia."
 TUR_vengeance_for_megali: "对希腊人复仇"
 TUR_vengeance_for_megali_desc: "Exploiting our moment of weakness, the Greek bastards have decided to invade the heart of our nation, arguing that it is rightful Greek territory. Now that we have regained some of our strength, we can send them an ultimatum: either they restore our control over the region, or they will be utterly destroyed by our military might. Hopefully they will be wise enough to realise the hopelessness of their situation."
 TUR_Iskanderrun: "伊斯肯德伦现状"
 TUR_Iskanderrun_desc: "The region of Iskenderun has always been a melting pot of Arab and Turkish people, which was enough of a justification for Syria to take the region from us after our defeat in the Desert War. However, seeing as there are still many Turks living in the area, this is something we simply cannot accept. It is time to undermine Syria's influence over the region and to remind the people living there of their allegiance to [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 TUR_a_new_army: "国民新军"
 TUR_a_new_army_desc: "The Ottoman army must be transformed into an army composed of Turks. While the army of the Ottoman Empire was composed of conscripts from all over the Empire, our new army should solely be composed of brave Turks. Moreover, our new army will no longer have to defend vast stretches of desert. Instead, it will be able to modernise itself and consider the offensive again."
 TUR_modern_soldier: "现代士兵"
 TUR_modern_soldier_desc: "Modern Turkish soldiers have to adapt to the harsh conditions of today's mobile and world wars. The wars stretch on fronts from Siberia to the African deserts, but also use modern technologies such as tanks - the new steel monsters."
 TUR_modern_mechanisation: "扩大装甲研究预算"
 TUR_modern_mechanisation_desc: "We should create a new budget share in the army to develop research on armour. The new means of locomotion and destruction are often very expensive to produce. By improving our research drastically, we could reduce the production cost of our tanks."
 TUR_redirect_naval_project: "调整海军计划"
 TUR_redirect_naval_project_desc: "The navy is also a weapon that must be relied upon and developed in order to compensate for the loss of our ports in the Middle East. New shipyards based in Smyrna would allow us to design and construct modern vessels."
 TUR_turkish_high_command: "最高指挥部现状"
 TUR_turkish_high_command_desc: "The question of the high command still remains unsolved. Indeed, ever since the complete takeover by the OHF, a significant number of members of the high command have become increasingly attached to politics. By creating a law on the status of the high command, by separating it from the government, and by preventing active militarymen from exercising a political career, we will hopefully be able to reduce our army's influence on our nation's political scene."
 TUR_high_command_tooltip: "§RIf our national stability is not high enough and rebels wage a devastating war against the government, the bill could have irrevocable consequences...§!"
 TUR_learn_from_the_cp_war: "沙漠战争的教训"
 TUR_learn_from_the_cp_war_desc: "Our defeat against the Cairo Pact was disastrous. We must learn from it, and prepare to take our revenge, not as the Ottoman Empire but as the Turkish people. Moreover, this learning will not only serve us against the Arabs but also help us defend our nation against other threats."
 TUR_prepare_for_the_next_war: "准备下一场战争"
 TUR_prepare_for_the_next_war_desc: "Now that our defeat is understood, we must focus on the success of our next campaigns. Especially sincem with diplomatic relations broken down all over Europe, it will be impossible for us to remain neutral without having to defend ourselves."
 TUR_study_air_warfare: "我们的未来在天空"
 TUR_study_air_warfare_desc: "Air warfare is one of the engines of modern warfare, allowing us to gain information, cover battalions on the ground or bomb strategic points. We must prepare for our future in the skies."
 TUR_turkish_supremacy: "元帅至上"
 TUR_turkish_supremacy_desc: "Fevzi Çakmak, the hero of the OHF and the Weltkrieg, came to power. From now on, he will do everything he can to eradicate all resistance to the Kemalist reforms, to implement these reforms in detail, to transform the economic plan in order readapt it to the army, and finally to establish the cult of the Mareşal."
 TUR_civic_independence: "人民主权与公民独立"
 TUR_civic_independence_desc: "Civic independence or popular sovereignty is the confrontation between many centuries of Muslim and institutional traditions. This stage is marked in particular by the abolition of the Millet system and the end of the autonomies relating to the different religions as well as the hierarchy of the Ulema and the Sheikh al-Islam."
 TUR_unification_and_co_education: "统一教育与男女同校"
 TUR_unification_and_co_education_desc: "The Unification and Co-education decree, one of the most emblematic decrees of the OHF government, consists first of all of the creation of a public education system, the restriction of religious schools that had become private, and above all the training of imams by the state in order to avoid extremist currents. Co-education or education for girls allowed the nation's women to have access to school."
 TUR_Turkish_civil_code: "土耳其民法典"
 TUR_Turkish_civil_code_desc: "The Turkish civil code will be based on the Swiss civil code, the most modern of its time, according to a committee formed for the purpose. The main advances include the status of women in marriage and a total ban on polygamy, which shall no longer be practised. This will be the beginning of complete equality in Turkey."
 TUR_women_rights: "女性权利"
 TUR_women_rights_desc: "Women's rights must now extend to politics in order to achieve full equality in the nation. In addition, women's rights and feminist organisations must develop with the support of the government and the party. These can now be elected as well. However, male domestic dominance is not yet resolved."
 TUR_family_name_law: "姓氏问题"
 TUR_family_name_law_desc: "土耳其人不存在姓氏。所有人都有一个名字，通常还有一个绰号，这可能是头衔，或者是来自他们父亲名字的称呼。这项改革让每位公民选择一个名称，令自己与众不同，进而实现国家的西化。不过，每个名称都必须有土耳其渊源。"
 TUR_abolition_of_ottoman_titles: "废除奥斯曼头衔"
 TUR_abolition_of_ottoman_titles_desc: "既然名称问题已经提出，那么就必须解决后续问题，要么废除头衔，要么至少减少头衔重要性及其等级内涵。我们想要废除歧视和封建制度，而头衔正是这些糟粕的体现。"
 TUR_question_of_caliphate: "孤独的哈里发"
 TUR_question_of_caliphate_desc: "The final question, the one that every government politician dreads: the abolition of the Caliphate. As Kemal wrote in black and white in the last line of his political testament: the Caliphate must be abolished. However, the measure is not established by a simple sentence. Many politicians would stop supporting the government if this step were to be taken. It would mark the closing of the Ottoman book."
 TUR_language_question: "土耳其语言委员会"
 TUR_language_question_desc: "The reform of the alphabet can finally be established. This question had been on the minds of many reformers since the Tanzimat era, but only Kemal appeared to be a real advocate. This would both modernise the nation and bring it together culturally. As the Latin alphabet has only about 30 characters, it would also improve literacy in the country."
 TUR_turkic_history: "突厥历史"
 TUR_turkic_history_desc: "We need to move away from the simple image of the Ottoman Empire linked to Islam. The Turkish nation was not born during the creation of the religion - it was born much earlier. The first Turkish nations date, according to many historians, from the nomadic people of the Asian plains, in Siberia or China, who came down to Europe through Central Asia and Russia. Let us adopt this glorious image of the Turkish warrior people."
 TUR_western_calendar_and_system: "西方历法与单位制"
 TUR_western_calendar_and_system_desc: "The European metric and time system is not the same as ours. We still give a lot of importance to the Muslim calendar and its metric system, despite the fact that many institutions have already disowned it."
 TUR_state_secularism: "国家世俗主义"
 TUR_state_secularism_desc: "State secularism is the absolute step that Kemal wanted to achieve, no longer simply separating religion and politics but above all applying secularism as a watchword for the whole nation. An end to religious obscurantism, as Kemal wrote: 'Superstition must go. Let them worship as they will, every man can follow his own conscience provided it does not interfere with sane reason or bid him act against the liberty of his fellow men.'"
 TUR_the_new_turkish_identity: "回顾国民认同"
 TUR_the_new_turkish_identity_desc: "Now that the reforms have been completed, we can take stock of the Turkish identity that has been achieved in such a short time, proving the power of our people. If the reforms have been followed, then Kemal's will promises a great future for our nation."
 TUR_seize_minorities_monopolies: "夺取少数群体垄断"
 TUR_seize_minorities_monopolies_desc: "Since the tanzimats and the Millet system, many minorities, especially Christians, had monopolies on many sectors, both industrial and banking. Thus, due to different laws and more lucrative ways of thinking, many companies have come under European influence because their owners were Christian. It is time to have them seized by the state."
 TUR_dissolve_western_influence: "消除西方影响"
 TUR_dissolve_western_influence_desc: "The development methods of European and Asian countries have diverged in the capitalist era. In order to achieve independence from the European powers, the foundations of liberalism must be abolished. The theoreticians of the Kadro paper believe, like Lenin, that from a fundamental point of view, the national political independence of each colonised country or almost each colonised country would allow the destruction of the capitalist-imperialist status quo."
 TUR_mix_western_populism: "混合西方民粹主义"
 TUR_mix_western_populism_desc: "《骨干》杂志是欧洲民粹主义和民族主义思想的混合体，杂志作者的思想充满了基本的马克思主义逻辑。然而，马克思主义可不允许他们主张民族和民族主义的概念，于是他们通过拒斥种族主义和帝国主义，进而能够将民族主义原则赋予这种准马克思主义意识形态。他们也拒斥以法团主义消灭阶级的国家民粹主义原则。"
 TUR_total_welfare_state: "总体福利国家"
 TUR_total_welfare_state_desc: "《骨干》杂志主张将私营部门排除在决策之外。他们认为国家才应该为大部分工业投资负责。因此，有计划的“国家主义”经济发展将有意识地胚芽给知识分子“骨干”，以限制各种社会阶级的形成，这种“骨干”独立于任何社会阶级，并将国家利益视为最高优先事项。"
 TUR_permanent_revolutionism: "不断革命论"
 TUR_permanent_revolutionism_desc: "不断革命论受到列宁理念的启发，其内容坚信革命的第一阶段是取得国家政治独立，第二阶段则是经济独立。最后，党必须由一位领导骨干统领，一位愿意为革命和革命党献身的人。而这个人正是穆罕默德·雷杰普·佩克尔。"
 TUR_kadroism_movement: "骨干运动"
 TUR_kadroism_movement_desc: "骨干运动的主要目标是消除西方列强对土耳其政治和经济领域的影响，但通过土耳其身份认同和无阶级化社会来模仿他们的发展。在这种社会中，国家负责生产和分配。"

 TUR_who_rules_the_air_rules_on_earth_desc: "As Kemal understood during the Weltrkrieg, those with air superiority can rule the seas and the land. We should once again adopt this doctrine of fighting on two scales."
 TUR_recover_from_the_disaster: "从灾难中恢复"
 TUR_recover_from_the_disaster_desc: "The defeat in the Desert War has left our nation in a severely weakened state. We were forced to concede many of our former territories to the Arabs, countless lives were lost and the entire Middle East set ablaze. But now is not the time to look to the past and weep over what once was. Now is the time to look to the future, and to begin rebuilding what we still have."
 TUR_proclaim_the_state_of_emergency: "宣布紧急状态"
 TUR_proclaim_the_state_of_emergency_desc: "The Mareşal sees our nation threatened from every quarter, with our foreign enemies being numerous and even more lurking within our own borders. Until this crisis has abated, the state of emergency must be proclaimed in order to secure the power needed to safeguard the people."
 TUR_arrest_the_opposition_leaders: "逮捕反对派领导人"
 TUR_arrest_the_opposition_leaders_desc: "The parties that have not yet chosen to incorporate themselves into the OHF are beginning to become a major problem for the government. They do not like what has been done since the proclamation of the state of emergency, and are now openly protesting against Fevzi and his policies. In order for him to truly achieve his goals, they must either be tamed...or destroyed."
 TUR_deal_with_protestors: "解决抗议者"
 TUR_deal_with_protestors_desc: "Protests from the people have only grown louder since the coup. They are scared, and their fear is understandable. However, many are merely spurred on by a few seeking to destroy what should be rebuilt. Those agitating against the leadership of the OHF must be contained or else the Mareşal's hold over our nation will soon begin to crumble."
 TUR_bring_back_order: "恢复秩序"
 TUR_bring_back_order_desc: "The measures thus far taken have finally brought about the silence the OHF deems necessary to rebuild the country, and with the loudest of the opposition voices removed, the Mareşal can now focus on restoring peace and quiet among the people."
 TUR_use_the_army: "动用军队重建"
 TUR_use_the_army_desc: "The army is useful for more than just removing enemies of the state by force. It can assist in the reconstruction of our country by paving roads, cleaning up debris and damage, and caring directly for our people. Using the army for such tasks could, furthermore, also drum up support for the regime and serve as a show of force for the new government."
 TUR_fight_unemployment: "解决失业"
 TUR_fight_unemployment_desc: "Unemployment is a pox upon the people. It prevents them from living their lives in dignity, and, most importantly, from paying their taxes. Thus, we shall create as many jobs as needed, until everybody works for the good of Turkey!"
 TUR_strategic_reorganization: "战略重组"
 TUR_strategic_reorganization_desc: "Now that we have lost most of our underdeveloped provinces, we can refocus our development efforts on Anatolia. For this, we should start reorganising our railway and infrastructure system."
 TUR_start_the_fevzi_plan: "缜密计划"
 TUR_start_the_fevzi_plan_desc: "The recovery of our nation has to be a planned procedure if it is to go anywhere. To that end, the Mareşal has come up with a plan that focuses on centring our economic recovery around the military, and on nationalising anything and everything in order to ensure that our nation will never be defeated again."
 TUR_back_on_track: "国家重回正轨"
 TUR_back_on_track_desc: "The problems of late have disrupted the endeavours of the OHF greatly. Now that the situation is manageable again and with the government still holding on to its emergency powers, it's about time to get the plans of the Mareşal back into motion."
 TUR_proclaim_the_republic: "宣布成立共和国"

 TUR_controlled_democracy: "指导式民主"
 TUR_controlled_democracy_desc: "Democracy at its best allows the greatest among us to guide our people to a bright future. However, at its worst it could be used to undermine the sovereignty and security of our nation. The Mareşal has now decided that a more...controlled form of democracy is needed for our nation to flourish, claiming that it is the only way to protect our people from parties whom he perceives as a detriment to our nation's future."
 TUR_maresal_cult: "元帅崇拜"
 TUR_maresal_cult_desc: "In order to further increase the support for the new regime among the populace, the leadership of the THF is planning to launch a campaign aimed at turning the Mareşal into a national hero, one comparable to the great Osman I, who laid the foundations for a Turkish state way back in the 13th century. From now on, posters praising Fevzi and his duties shall decorate the streets of all Turkish cities."
 TUR_father_of_the_people: "人民的慈父"
 TUR_father_of_the_people_desc: "'Mustafa Fevzi Çakmak shall guide our people!', the posters have proclaimed for the longest time now. However, portraying the Mareşal as a national hero does not seem to be enough for the THF anymore. The party wants to go a step further and is now propagating Fevzi as a father figure, one that takes care of the Turkish people as if they were his very own children."
 TUR_create_turkish_youth: "创建土耳其青年组织"
 TUR_create_turkish_youth_desc: "The people have to be influenced at a younger age if they shall become valuable and obedient members of the new Turkish society. By establishing youth organisations in the army and the THF, the government will be able to interest the younger generations in politics and the military, whilst also limiting the influence of non-state organisations on the Turkish youth."
 TUR_a_benevolent_leader: "强硬领袖"
 TUR_a_benevolent_leader_desc: "Mareşal Mustafa Fevzi Çakmak's success in saving our nation from the brink of collapse has made a large part of our population abandon their doubts of his rule and the somewhat excessive measures thus far taken to secure it. Though some still say he rules with an iron fist, none can deny that this fist has lots of strength and shrewdness behind it."
 TUR_empower_gendarmerie: "授权宪兵"
 TUR_empower_gendarmerie_desc: "For the gendarmes to be able to uphold the new regime, they must be able to carry out their job without interference by the courts or the enemies of the people, as the Mareşal now calls those threatening his rule. Thus, our government is now working on passing the policies needed to ensure that the gendarmerie can operate with the utmost efficiency and crush all criminal elements within Turkey."
 TUR_party_supremacy: "一党专政"
 TUR_party_supremacy_desc: "在帝国崩溃之后，是土耳其人民党在废墟中重建了我们的国家，带领焕然一新的民族向未来前进。其余的政党要么是只会指手画脚的多余闲人，要么更危险，是土耳其之敌。为了现政府的稳定，我们必须保证人民能理解上述原则，认同我们的一党专政是出于善意的，这最终会让人民拥护人民党的领导。"
 TUR_stay_cordial_towards_religion: "尊重宗教"
 TUR_stay_cordial_towards_religion_desc: "现代的世俗政治和宗教间……总有些复杂的联系。为了保证国家的强大，不能搞政教合一，但人民也希望政府对宗教持尊重的态度。如果我们对宗教人士采取宽松的政策，不做鲁莽的事，比如彻底废除哈里发，我们就能确保信徒也会回报我们的政府以尊重。"
 TUR_call_for_legislative_elections: "呼吁立法选举"
 TUR_call_for_legislative_elections_desc: "Although the THF claims to be the only party needed, it should still be ensured that those who want a multi-party system are satisfied. Though the Mareşal will likely want to remain in his current position, the people could nevertheless be allowed to at least elect appropriate candidates to the legislature."
 TUR_a_modern_state: "现代国家的诞生"
 TUR_a_modern_state_desc: "旧日的老大帝国已死，新生的现代国家将立。虚弱而落后的帝国给人民带来的只有深重的灾难，我们从历史中吸取教训，以建立一个真正的现代国家。新生的祖国将在嘈杂乱世中超然独立。"

 TUR_apply_fevzi_plan_desc: "It is about time for the plans drafted by the Mareşal to come into effect. In order to realise the goals he set for our economy and for the nation as a whole, we must nationalise our industries, build up infrastructure, and raise an army ready to enter the world stage!"

 TUR_establish_modernity: "建立现代化"
 TUR_establish_modernity_desc: "The modern world is full of useful conveniences: better military equipment, improved means of communication and transportation, and an overabundance of other fancy new toys to play with.

 TUR_electrification_program: "电气化项目"

Now, the time to act upon these promises has come."
 TUR_promote_military_academies: "推动军事学院"
 TUR_promote_military_academies_desc: "For the Mareşal, who spent much of his youth enrolled at a military academy, these institutions are the backbone of the army, and should be funded as such. After all, they play a major role in spotting and fostering young talents, and supporting these academies would, furthermore, also incentivise a greater share of our youth to sign up for the military."
 TUR_the_new_turkish_soldier: "新土耳其士兵"
 TUR_the_new_turkish_soldier_desc: "The soldiers of old have failed our country and have become a stain on the pride of our nation.

Every single soldier of our army shall resemble this model, protect our people, and show the world our might!"
 TUR_oriental_vanguard: "东方先锋"
 TUR_oriental_vanguard_desc: "Our old alliances can still benefit our state, and it is no longer sensible to hold on to the grudges ignited by the signing of the Jerusalem Accords in 1920. Let us align with Berlin once more, and show the Germans how powerful our newly modernised state has become!"
 TUR_create_the_national_road: "宏伟国道"

 TUR_pearl_of_two_continent_desc: "Many have debated whether our nation is European or Asiatic - an utterly foolish question. We are both, and we benefit greatly from being the link between east and west, as shown by the significant amount of trade routes going through our lands."
 TUR_great_military_project: "军事大计划"
 TUR_great_military_project_desc: "Part of the weakness of the Empire stemmed from its ailing and poorly equipped military.

However, until then, there is much more to be done."
 TUR_modernise_army_fevzi: "军队现代化"
 TUR_modernise_army_fevzi_desc: "Our army has shown its weaknesses in past wars, and if our nation is to survive the oncoming storm, our military must be able to face the challenges of modern-day combat. For this purpose, the Mareşal has orchestrated a series of reforms aimed at determining the status of our army and its specialisation, and at improving its overall capabilities."
 TUR_a_revanchist_goal: "复仇主义目标"
 TUR_a_revanchist_goal_desc: "沙漠战争之后，我们被迫签署和平条约，将几个世纪以来的土耳其领土拱手让出，敌人们可能正希望我们会很快消沉下去，放弃一切扩张野心。然而，土耳其民族已在在元帅领导下重建，而现在，复仇的时刻到来了。"
 OTT_economic_collapse: "经济崩溃"
 OTT_economic_collapse_desc: "我们在沙漠战争中战败，大部分非土耳其领土沦丧，自那以来，国家经济已陷入崩溃。我国大部分基建要么在东部被摧毁，要么在西部被瓦解。此外，我们的民用经济的主要部分已被截断。"

 TUR_relation_with_iraq_desc: "Among the new Arab states born in the wake of the Desert War was the young nation of Iraq. Unlike the other Arabs, who felt mistreated under our rule, the people of Iraq were more or less content with their situation in the Empire. This can be traced back to the interest the Porte had in the Iraqi oil fields and the strategic situation of Iraq on the Persian border, two factors that led to the Porte focusing its development efforts not just on Anatolia but on Iraq as well. Sadly, the thoughts of Arab nationalism managed to spread to the region regardless, resulting in its secession from the Empire.\n\nHowever, it may be a wise idea to accept this development. If we were to reestablish diplomatic relations with Iraq and renounce our claims on their territory, we might be able to make a new friend not too far from our home country, which is worth far more than one might think. Seeing how the Persians are eyeing up the Iraqi lands, the government of Iraq would surely also be glad to gain a new ally in these trying times."

In the past, this has often led to waves of unrest and numerous revolts in which the Kurds tried to fight for their freedom. Even though we were able to crush these revolts using our sheer military might, the stubbornness of the Kurdish people prevented us from centralising their lands. However, it should also be noted that the Kurdish people are by no means united. Their lands are split between many tribes with varying interests.

 tur.1.d: "The debacle of the Empire has come to an end. The storm has finished blowing and the dust has settled. The Ottoman Empire reveals itself as a victim of the unjust treaty imposed by the Cairo Pact, which saw the end of the century-long Ottoman hegemony in the Middle East. The people that had fled during the war and in its aftermath have now settled by the thousands in Anatolia, famines and massacres were numerous during their flight. The Turkish troops are disorganised, and many soldiers, especially of Arab origin, have already deserted, hoping to find a more glorious future elsewhere, and the world has lost all respect for our nation. These are dark times for the Empire. Sultan Abdülmecid II watches this spectacle from his window, horrified.\n\nThe government of the day no longer shows its face, it knows what it is getting into. The people are grumbling, who are these politicians that led the Empire to its ruin in the belief that they are reforming it? One gets the impression that external affairs have been disregarded in favour of political conflicts of interest. Everyone is waiting for the event that will mark a turning point in this disarray. Since the Sultan seems to be the only one with power in this decisive moment, many refer to him. Finally, Abdülmecid announced to his aide-de-camp that he is going to abdicate. He had seen the glory days of the Empire after the Great War, but had been unable to leave the puppet function that had been imposed on his predecessors.\n\nAhmed Nihad, grandson of the ill-fated Sultan Murad V, has been proclaimed Sultan of the Ottoman Empire under the name Ahmed IV. He followed the usual ceremony and was elected Caliph of all of Islam by the Meclis-i Mebûsan. He has been enthroned as 'Khalifa of the Muslims and Custodian of the Holy Places' and now wears the historical mantle - to the disliking of many deputies."

They called on the troops to rebel and the people to restore Ahmed IV as the legitimate Caliph. However, this appeal to the people went relatively unheeded, for they still feel betrayed by the OHF and believe that Ahmed failed to prevent such crisis. Nevertheless, many localities and institutions, mainly in the large cities, announced their support for the democratically elected party and rejected what many call the Evening Coup.\n\nAfter the initial euphoria following the success of the coup, the new government realised that its task was not going to be easy. The OHF has left its mark on the institutions and has already established many reforms that seem difficult to reverse. It will certainly be quite the endeavour to go back on very progressive and liberal reforms and fight the OHF presence in local administrations at the same time. Furthermore, many are still questioning the righteousness of the OSP rule, seeing as [TUR.GetLeader]'s reign has not yet been approved by an Ottoman Sultan, another issue which will have to be addressed in the future if the Empire is to withstand the sands of time."

All of this happened with the blessing of the Shaykh al-Islam, which is why most of the influential minorities of the Empire and also the conservatives now support the new government.\n\nNobody can dispute that the OSP coalition is a real political success. Numerous parties have decided to become a part of the coalition, and Refet Pasha is generally considered to be the saviour of democracy and religious justice in our nation. Although our people still wish for the return of a Sultan and are thus not entirely content with the current situation, the future seems to once again shine bright for an Empire that until recently was on the brink of collapse."

The elimination of the military resistance of the OHF and the opposition brought a wind of freedom to all those exiled and oppressed by the authoritarian government. Furthermore, the implementation of reforms by Mustafa Sabri allowed the government to win the hearts of many politicians and the conservative milieu alike. Finally, the policy of economic revival and recovery promulgated by Fatin Rüstü Bey made the people regain their faith in the government and rekindled a feeling of Turkish national pride.\nNow, the Meclis-i Mebûsan has been restored and the deputies were called upon to return to their seats and prepare for the election that will define the future of the coalition."

They are mainly led by Kazim Karabekir, who was granted leadership of the party in exchange for allowing Prince Sabahattin the free implementation of his progressive reforms, that were inspired by his stay in France, with the help of a committee.\n\nTheir opponent is the conservative wing of the OSP. The conservatives are mainly democrats who no longer want anti-religious reforms and instead aim to strengthen the relations of the government with the Sultan Caliph. They rejected the practices of Shakib Arslan's Mohammedan Union and found themselves led by the Shaykh al-Islam himself, Sabri Efendi. Efendi is a Muslim scholar, who believes that Islam is still the religion of science, just like it has been in earlier centuries, during which Eastern scholars made up the forefront of technological advances. He is also the leader of the Teali-i Islam Cemiyeti (Society for the Elevation of Islam).\n\nSince both wings of the party seem to be pretty popular among the people, one could only speculate who would be able to win the election.

Sabahattin and Karabekir are both progressive men of the Empire and wish to extend the political rights of the women of our nation. However, the coalition does not entirely agree with this idea, because it was seen as a bit too modernist. Some conservatives even accused Sabahattin and Karabekir of being in league with the OHF.

However, in order for a democracy to be functional and not turn into an oligarchy, the entire population must vote. If the abstention rate is too high, a minority controls the vote and with it the power.

This science is very important, especially in politics, as it allows a better understanding of the relationships between individuals in society. This is why sociology is said to extend to all human sciences. Politically, Durkheim was not a Marxist but a friend of Jean Jaurès and had a leaning towards reformist socialism.\n\nSabahattin discovered and adopted sociology during his exile in France. When he was later exiled to Switzerland, he had time to develop this passion and his democratic ideas at the same time. His project of decentralisation of the Empire came from political sociological theses.\n\nSabahattin wants to create a university of sociology, the first in the Empire, as sociology was previously linked to philosophy. This university would train new Turkish scientists and allow for the modern development of Ottoman thought."

It is the highest instance of commercial law within the Empire. However, with the development of liberalism, this code, which has not been modified since its creation in 1809, seems outdated and appears to do more harm than good. A committee of jurists, together with business leaders, was set up to amend the code, in order to bring it up to modern standards."

[TUR.GetLeader] hurriedly took his horse and sent numerous telegrams to try to stop the insurgents. After they did not heed his calls to lay down their weapons, the Pasha gathered soldiers still loyal to the government and began to advance against the rebels. According to the latest news, it was more of a skirmish and sporadic clashes than a real revolt and was put down rather quickly. Still, many of our soldiers were wounded or even killed.

In a government initiative, sociologists from all over Europe came to admire the opening congress of the Durkheim Institute, which has been named in honour of the sociologist who inspired the sociological and political thinking of Prince Sabahattin. The Sultan himself also came to greet the professors and scientists present. During the congress, a tribute was paid to the Prince by Emmanuel Levinas, a French-Lithuanian philosopher.

 tur_osp.27.d: "Prince Ömer Faruk Efendi has alway been admired by the people for the bravery he demonstrated during the Weltkrieg and the Desert War. Furthermore, he has been a close friend and associate of Refet Bele Pasha for quite some time now, and it is no secret that his political views mostly align with those of the OSP. For most of the country, it seemed almost certain that if someone was to be proclaimed Sultan by the provisional government, he would be the one chosen. Still, Refet first wanted to stabilise the nation, and felt that he needed full control of the executive powers usually reserved for our Sultans in order to reach this goal.\n\nNow, however, with life in the country slowly returning to normal and the influence of the OHF at an all-time low, it was decided that the time for a Sultan to return to the throne of the Empire had come. As anticipated, the government approached Ömer, who didn't hesitate to accept their offer. His coronation ceremony was held in Dolmabahçe Palace not too long thereafter. As per Ottoman tradition, the ceremony started with Ömer saying a prayer in front of the holy relics of the Empire, followed by him taking his place on the throne and some of the most important OSP politicians congratulating him and kissing his robes. After the Shaykh-al-Islam said a final prayer, Ömer and the leaders of the provisional government rode to the Eyüp Sultan Mosque, where, after another short prayer, Ömer underwent the sword ceremony, during which he symbolically buckled on the sword of Osman I. With the end of the ceremony, Ömer had officially become Ömer I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and Caliph of Islam. Throughout the country, our people are celebrating, for their nation is now no longer without a proper leader."

 tur_osp.28.d: "Usually, news from the palace is met with excitement from the public, as most commoners are always eager to find out more about the lives of the members of the royal family. This time, however, it was met with sorrow and even outrage, as our beloved Sultan and Caliph Ömer I has announced his divorce, officialising the end of his marriage with Sabiha Sultan.\n\nYoung Ömer and Sabiha, the youngest daughter of Mehmed VI, fell in love shortly after the end of the Weltkrieg, and, despite numerous other men requesting her hand in marriage, the young love was allowed to bloom, and their union made official in marriage. Since then, the couple has been blessed with the birth of three daughters, and things were seemingly going well for the lovers. Not all that glitters is gold, however, and behind the facade, the relationship was slowly but surely falling apart, a development which was only aggravated by Ömer's increased intertwinement with the Empire's military - and by now, of course, also political and religious - affairs following the outbreak and loss of the Desert War. Though news of the marriage's deterioration has been trickling down to the public and spreading through the nation's newspaper outlets, few expected it to go as far as it has, and the exact reasons for the divorce have yet to be revealed to the common citizen, with Ömer only giving a very vague explanation in his address.\n\nDespite the right to divorce being enshrined in Islam, it is generally not seen as very laudable, and, as such, Conservatives have been quick to call out Ömer, accusing him of \"staining the pure mantle of the holy Caliphate\" and \"bringing dishonour to Islam itself\". Some have, however, also interpreted Ömer's decision as a sign of modernity and a step forward for the age-old institution that is the Caliphate. For the most part, though, the nation lies in shock, eagerly awaiting what comes next for both their Sultan and Sabiha."

A few weeks back, however, the Sultan came forward to his nation and announced his upcoming wedding with his cousin Mihrişah Sultan, daughter of Yusuf Izzettin Efendi. Though this is rather unusual behaviour for a Sultan, most of our citizen welcomed this news, embraced it as another sign of the Sultan's modernity, and were quickly caught up in the general wave of excitement about the upcoming wedding.\n\nAfter weeks of extensive preparations and planning, today the time had finally come. The ceremony itself was held in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but kept relatively brief, with Ömer and Mihrişah each saying their vows before the Shaykh al-Islam, whom the Sultan personally asked to lead the ceremony, in the early morning hours after a short sermon. Once the formalities were behind them, the couple led a procession through the city, much to the joy of the common folk, who met the royal family with thunderous applause and countless cheers. The procession ended at the royal palace, where a lavish feast was organised for the Sultan's relatives and some high-ranking party officials, with festivities being expected to last for another few days.\n\nThe leadership of the OSP has furthermore made sure to use this opportunity to the fullest to drum up popular support for the monarchy and the party, and has spent the last few weeks organising festivities in most major cities, which have now put the country in a general state of celebration and joy. Thus, the fortune of our Sultan has extended to the entire nation and has blessed it with a well-deserved distraction from the ongoing crises around the globe."

Promising to take into account the views of every group and party, from the staunch followers of Islam living by Sharia rules to the representatives of secularists and other religions of the empire.

 tur_osp.31.d: "The Grand Assembly gathered in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today to reform the country's main document and learn lessons from the constitutional era. Sultan Ömer opened the meeting with a brilliant speech, urging all present to be firm and hoping the assembly would make the best efforts for the country's welfare. He himself promised not to oppose any proposal to reduce his sultanic prerogatives, if that was the wish of the people, represented by all the deputies. The speech drew thunderous applause from the vast majority except for a few ardent Kemalist supporters who refused to boycott the assembly elections.\nThe most important issue on the agenda was the relationship between the Sultan and his Grand Vizier. Since the rise of the century, the Sultan had often been the victim of coups, in which rebels used force and the Constitutional right of the sovereign to appoint anyone to be head of the government and made their leader the Grand Vizier, thus giving him absolute power. Such actions made the Sultan a powerless observer and unable to do anything against the government, disliked either by him or by the people of the Empire. Recently there have even been voices in favour of abolishing the Sultanate, mostly among the army, where another rebel could easily appear.\nIn order to prevent such incidents from happening in the future, several suggestions were made. Progressive members of the Assembly propose to remove the Sultan's power of appointing the Vizier and hand it over to parliament, thus moving away from the Germanic model, which had proved flawed in Ottoman reality. Conservative representatives propose instead to make it impossible to abolish the Sultanate in the constitution, which, with proper wording, could be made irreversible, arguing that any plotters wouldn't respect the constitution anyway.\nSultan Ömer has promised to remain impartial, but members of the government are free to speak their minds. Which option would be preferable? "

 tur_osp.32.d: "The National Assembly completed its work today by submitting a new constitution to the Sultan for his signature. The resulting draft is much more modern and lacks the disadvantages of its predecessor. It also contains articles on the equality of all before the law, free exercise of religion and the right to inviolability, as well as the abolition of many authoritarian things that are incompatible with today's reality, such as the right of the Sultan to expel anyone from the country without trial. Ömer signed the document without further question and took the oath of allegiance to the new, second constitution. We hope that all this will help bring back to the empire the stability and prosperity it has long desired."

 tur_osp.33.t: "Fevzi Pasha Failed Revolt"
 tur_osp.33.d: "Despite the fall of Kemal's government, Fevzi Pasha decided to continue the struggle and go into hiding, although it was clear to all he could only expect to be arrested. In the clique of the OHF's main supporters - the military - he was in third place, after Kemal himself and Ismet - with some daring to challenge the latter's place in favour of Fevzi. So Pasha had few options left - either surrender now and be arrested, or revolt hoping to change the situation in the country.\nThis morning, hours before the decree banning the OHF and arresting its main members was to be signed, Fevzi and a handful of supporters appeared in the barracks of the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] garrison, where Pasha gave a fervent speech calling for an end to the outrages of the new government, even using the deposition of the sultan as an excuse. The garrison, most of whose ranks were connected with the OHF, quickly enough sided with the rebels and marched towards the government residence. This is where Fevzi's first blow awaited, as they found no one but minor officials similarly bewildered by the absence of an interim government. Capturing several of the petitioners as 'prisoners', Pasha hastily started sending messages to other regions of the country, hoping to get support from wherever. But it turned out that communications had been blocked and troops loyal to the OSP were already gathering outside the city, led by the legitimate government.\nBy evening, having realised the hopelessness of the situation and unable to gain support from the people in the capital, Fevzi had surrendered to the provisional government. Most of the OHF supporters had also surrendered, except for the most stubborn, who preferred to go on the run again. The government is no longer under any significant threat, and the country has embarked on its inexorable road to democracy."

 tur.3.d: "Over the course of the week, numerous alarming reports reached the ears of the government of the Sublime Porte. In the underworld of [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], several secret associations were discovered. These organisations mostly conduct illegal arms trade and supply a number of citizens with weapons that, theoretically, only the military should have access to. In addition, there were a large number of deserters, which shocked the high command, since it was believed that the end of the war had satisfied the men. As if this alone was not scary enough, seeing how our army was already disorganised and underequipped before these men deserted, there were also some officers that, after officially resigning from the army, took the train to eastern Anatolia. Could it be to join the nationalist resistance movement?"

 tur.5.d: "After the success of the coup, the government of Kemal took stock of the situation, and realised one thing: The situation looks desperate. Before the new government could implement the promised reforms, it would first have to deal with the internal struggles that plague the nation.\n\nThe first difficulty is obviously the impact the HIF had on the country. Democratic and decentralist reforms will be difficult, but not entirely impossible to reverse. If this goal is to be achieved, it will be necessary to make the people and the administrations understand that the Kemalist reforms are the only things able to save the Empire in these dark times.\n\nHowever, this is not the only task ahead of Kemal and his supporters. They will also have to deal with the economic crisis affecting the country. Indeed, the loss of half of the Empire's land has inevitably had an impact on the general standard of living as well as on the country's productive capacity.\n\nIf Kemal manages to deal with these internal problems, he will surely have regained the trust of the people. Even though the situation may look dire, the Pasha is full of hope and confident in his abilities to lead the people into a brighter future."

The Shaykh al-Islam himself called on the government to show religious tolerance and respect for traditions, fearing that the Kemalists might trample on these values. Many muftis, hodjas and imams have already organised rallies to protest against the fall of the liberal coalition and the rise of the \"illegitimate nationalist regime\". In the eastern parts of Anatolia, the traditionalist resistance has already become violent, as several gendarmes have been assassinated by Kurdish zealots.\n\n§RThe mechanics of traditionalism are now in place.

 tur.7.d: "Despite the Gazi's political withdrawal, death decided to come knocking at his door. Very early this morning, his friend Ali Fethi, who was to visit him for their usual walk, went to the Pasha's flats. His aide-de-camp, who was awakened to fetch him, found him lying in his bed, dead. After hearing this terrible news, Fethi's first words were: 'Kemal, my friend, what will we do without you?', for the Gazi had recently refused to be called Mustafa. Another friend of his, Salih, shot himself in the chest after being informed of the death of the Pasha.\n\nThe OHF Party in Constantinople was quick to respond by declaring an official national day of mourning. The party also issued a joint statement, in which it thanked the Pasha, referred to as \"Halâskâr Gazi\", the Saviour Gazi (Holy Warrior), for his actions during the war. Furthermore, various vessels, both small and large, military and civilian, sailed in front of Kemal's seashore villa, shouting, crying and waving the Ottoman flag in memory of the man now forever captivated in the legacy of our Grand Empire."

Although many party members claim that Kemal personally chose Ismet Pasha as his successor, some also argued that Kemal was a progressive man, and that his last wish was to restore democracy upon his death in order to stabilise the country. Celal Bayar and Rauf Pasha are among those who demand the organisation of internal elections in the party. Ismet remained strangely silent during the extraordinary session, only defended by Kemal's closest friends.\n\nIt appears that this endless debate over Kemal's will has now divided the party, which was the only source of stability after the Gazi's death. This instability and infighting led to some people believing that there could be an opportunity for the opposition to strike once again..."

 tur.9.d: "In the afternoon, the party leadership received disturbing news: The Imperial Palace had been taken over and the Osman family taken hostage in the wake of a political coup attempt. The plotters also swiftly took control of the Ministry of War, making prisoners of some of the OHF politicians present there. The person responsible is said to be General Fahrettin Fakhri Pasha, the defender of Medina. The old general is known for his attachment to Islam, religious values and traditions, and is said to be under surveillance by Kemalist agents for his discontent with the new government. In any case, with the capture of the symbolic power entity and the high command, all that is left for him to do is to take the party headquarters in order to capture the government for his coup to be successful. However, a large part of the garrison remained loyal to the OHF, and the Sultan has not yet recognised the general's government.\n\nIsmet Pasha seems to have been presented a window of opportunity - and he is determined to end the illegitimate rule of the general prematurely. Surely, most soldiers and government officials present in the capital would support him if he were to stage a counter-coup against Fahrettin Pasha. He has to act quickly however - or the general will have taken control of the party headquarters before the day comes to an end."

Seeing the internal dissension of the party after the death of Gazi and the hopelessness of their situation made the OHF politicians question what they were fighting for, which led to them giving in to the demands. Fahrettin Pasha recognised this act of bravery and promised a fair trial to all Kemalist officials. After securing power, he returned to the Imperial Palace, where the Sultan was already waiting for him. Before the Sultan could congratulate the general, Fahrettin is said to have forced him to abdicate surrounded by the members of the new government, a coalition calling itself the Ottoman Salvation Party. The leadership of this new party is composed of the progressive minds Sabahattin Efendi and Kazim Karabekir, and the enigmatic Mustafa Sabri, the Shaykh al-Islam. The Defender of Medina became the leader of the government and promised to proclaim a new Sultan and hold free elections as soon as calm and peace prevailed in the country."

Known for his infrequent speeches and his deafness that allows him to ignore the arguments of his opponents, the Pasha is also known for his military and political career in the shadow of the Gazi. Determined and dressed in a frock coat, Ismet announced that he was the possessor of Kemal's will. He hastened to read out the part reserved for this purpose and announced that the rest was to be known only to the government.\n\nIn his will, Kemal named Ismet as his humble successor. He also expressed his sadness at the idea of dying without having been able to complete his ideas, ideas that he had kept for many years in his diary until the day when 'Turkey' would finally be ready. He wrote about his progressives ambitions, the importance of the Turkish identity and above all the creation of a real national sovereignty. He also asked the people to trust his successor and friend for the continuation of his thought."

 tur.12.t: "Mysticism in Anatolia"
 tur.12.d: "Sufi orders have long played an important role within the Ottoman Empire, and many of our past Sultans were part of these orders. Initially serving semi-independent from the state apparatus, these orders were brought closer to the central authority of the state during the top-down reforms of the CUP at the start of the 20th century. Reforms included centralisation and bureaucratisation of the brotherhoods, the creation of training courses for Sufi sheikhs, the institution of detailed dress policies, and inspections of the practices of various orders. Slowly but surely, the orders became a part of the Ottoman state itself.\n\nWith their closer attachment to the state, however, came a closer connection to the political scene in Kostantiniyye, and although only a minority of the population is part of one of these orders, their deep connection to the men of power has led to unbridled corruption and political influence. Some even go so far as to say that the electoral victory and bestowment of the Grand Vizier title on the leader of the HIF was directly caused by these orders in an attempt to halt the Kemalist reforms.\n\nThe different orders range from the Mevlevi tarikat or \"Whirling Dervishes\" to the more powerful Kadiri tarikat, whose close support of the Sultans has in the past led to them becoming the kingmaker in the capital. As the Grand Vizier has shown his desire to greatly limit the power of these organisations, many of them are attempting to sway uncertain party members to block his proposal. The Sultan himself has also in private conversation with the Grand Vizier and multiple Sheiks from the orders showed his discontent with the direction of the policies his Vizier pursues."

 tur.13.d: "Thus far deferring from personally intervening, the Caliph has finally seen himself forced to intervene against his own Grand Vizier. As the radical secularisation is done with almost brute force, he isn't the only one opposing the reforms which are fundamentally changing the Ottoman state and, at least according to the conservatives, inflicting massive damage on the pillars of its society, bordering on heresy and treason to the Caliph.\n\nThe Sultan-Caliph, who not only leads the Ottoman Empire but all of Islam itself, has therefore called for a meeting with the Shaykh al-Islam and his cabinet to revert their decision to close the Sufi lodges and to reinstate their influence. Outside of the palace walls, protests are rocking the nation, as conservative hotbeds such as Bursa, Konya and Lazistan angrily react to the reforms."
 tur.13.a: "You don't have any power here!"
 tur.14.t: "苏丹头衔的命运"
 tur.14.d: "One of Gazi Mustafa Kemal's deepest wishes was the creation of a Turkish republic, separate from the minorities who wanted the nation dead. The republic the Gazi dreamed of was to be based on nationalism and democracy. Many party members considered the reform feasible. Indeed, since the 1909 coup d'état by the CUP, the Sultan has merely been a puppet of the governing parties. He does not truly lead the nation anymore, even though Abdülmecid II has been more influential than his predecessors.\n\nIf the reform came into effect, the title of Padishah would be split between the Caliph and the Sultan, with the Sultan retaining his religious but not political authority. Sultan [TUR.GetLeader] could not oppose the measure due to the weakness of his authority.\n\nThe abolition of the Sultanate would be a turning point in world history. It would put a definitive end to the existence of the Ottoman Empire. It would nevertheless also allow for a better implementation of the secularisation planned by Kemal and could overall be considered a great leap forward."

As the Sultan's aide-de-camp warned him of the vote that took place in the Meclis i-Mebûsan, the institution had already been reorganised into the Turkish National Assembly. The latter directly undertook the transformation of the post of Grand Vizier into that of Prime Minister, and later created an entirely new title - President. The election for the first President of the Republic was held within the Party. However, for most people, the result was already clear before the votes were even counted: Ismet Reşit won with an overwhelming majority of votes and was thus elected to lead our nation into its future. He proclaimed this in a patriotic speech to the nation, in which he said: \"I am following the will of Kemal. Word for word I shall make his dreams become reality. I shall save the Turkish people and rekindle their pride by pulling them out of obscurantism and religious superstition.\"\n\nWhile many see the beginning of a truly modern and great Turkish state in the newly founded republic, the Traditionalists remain sceptical. They fear the ambitions of their new President and can only imagine how far he is ready to go in the name of his dead Gazi."

 tur.16.t: "Standardisation of the Turkish Flag"
 tur.16.d: "The Ottoman flag has changed many times throughout history. For a long time our flag consisted of a yellow crescent on a red background (the symbol of the Turkish people), then three yellow crescents on a green background (the colour of Islam), and finally, more recently, a crescent and a star representing Islam and Turkey alike. However, there are some that still use the Tügra of the Sultan as an emblem. Therefore, Ismet initiated the standardisation of the Turkish flag. A committee specified the exact colour of the red, the size and geometry of the crescent and its proportions. From now on, our new and clearly defined flag shall show the world the pride and unity of the Turkish people!"

 tur.19.t: "Popular Sovereignty and Abolition of Millet System"
 tur.19.d: "The Millet system consists of giving a certain degree of autonomy to the different minorities of the Empire in the application of their religious laws, the collection of their taxes or their own local hierarchical system. In the Muslim religion, for example, the Ulema is headed by the Shaykh al-Islam, who dictates religious laws on the basis of the Shariah. This very unequal system for many people, especially in terms of criminal and commercial rights, has existed since the Tanzimat period. However, the system is beginning to show its age and does not fit into the modern and advanced state Turkey shall become. Seeing how the idea of Popular Sovereignty, or the equality of all Turkish citizens regardless of their religious affiliation before the law, has become increasingly popular, our government decided that it was about time to abolish the Millet system and enshrine the principle of equality before the law in the constitution."
 tur.19.a: "Another step towards progress."
 tur.20.t: "Unification and Co-education Finally Pushed"
 tur.20.d: "The project of Unification of Education, which can be translated into the privatisation of all religious learning institutions and the opening of national and secular public schools, was one of Kemal's most ambitious reforms. It also encompassed entrusting the state with the training of religious officials in order to avoid the creation of too radical a current and the spread of dangerous thoughts. The most radical part of this reform however is the decree on Co-Education. This decree gives Turkish girls equal rights to boys concerning their education, and allows them to visit the schools and learn the curricula that were formerly only accessible to men. Even though the Traditionalists are everything but happy with these reforms, arguing that they are an insult to the Turkish and Islamic culture, [TUR.GetLeader] decided to honour the will of the Gazi and to pave the way for a brighter future for the Turkish people."
 tur.20.a: "The teachers are the beacons of our new republic!"
 tur.21.t: "奥斯曼民法典"
 tur.21.d: "The Ottoman Civil Code or Mecca Code is a relic of the Tanzimat period in the modern era and was supposed to balance the Shariah with the laws of the modern world, but it soon became outdated in the CUP period. Kemal's plan was to replace it with a most modern Turkish Civil Code, which was to be inspired by the Civil Codes of other progressive European nations. The Comittee in charge of rewriting the code chose the Swiss one as the model for the new Turkish law. The most significant changes this conversion would bring our nation are modern rights for women on inheritance, marriage and divorce as well as parental rights. With the creation of the new Turkish Civil Code also came the creation of a new and more progressive Commercial Code. While they were both developed when Kemal was still alive, he sadly died without ever seeing them implemented, mostly because the Traditionalist forces tried to stop their implementation by all means. However, with the Traditionalists losing more and more influence to the progressive government of [TUR.GetLeader], the wish of the Gazi can finally be fulfilled and the dream of a new and modern Civil Code realised."
 tur.21.a: "但愿新民法典能为土耳其带来真正的平等！"
 tur.22.t: "女性权利"
 tur.22.d: "As Mustafa Kemal once said: 'If henceforward the women do not partake in the social life of the nation, we shall never attain our full development. We shall remain irremediably backward, incapable of treating on equal terms with the civilisations of the West.' Seeing how Turkish women already obtained greater rights than women from most other European countries with the reform of the penal code, the wish of the Gazi now seems more actionable than ever before. If we grant our women the political right to vote and to be elected, Turkey will be one of the most advanced European countries. By granting women the right to work in certain professions that are currently exclusively practised by men, we would give them a chance to show their talents, which would benefit our nation both socially and economically.\n\nHowever, once again the Traditionalists are urging us to limit the advancement of women's rights, to do it more gradually. As always, they stressed the value of our culture and our traditions, and argue that these advancements aren't compatible with Islam itself. Nevertheless, if we were to give in to their backwards demands, we would flout Kemal's will - and the Gazi would be turning in his grave."

 tur.23.d: "The law of nicknames belongs to the most important laws of our country because it affects the very identity of every Turkish person. As per Ottoman tradition, newborn children are only given names that originate from the Koran. Often times they are subsequently also given nicknames based on their physical or behavioural attributes. For example, Kemal is a name given to very talented and overall perfect men. However, many people are also given their father's name after their own in order to make their kinship easily identifiable. While this system has been in place for many years now, it's about time we ask ourselves: Can a modern nation progress when individuals are drowned in a mass without individualisation? Should we really force our people to choose religious names for their children? Obviously, the answer to both of these questions is no. We shall make sure that every citizen will have a chance to choose their own name of Turkish origin!"

 tur.24.t: "奥斯曼头衔问题"
 tur.24.d: "The most important Ottoman titles are probably Bey, meaning Sir, Efendi, expressing the wisdom of an individual, and Pasha, which is an honorary title given to governors, generals and others. These titles, which have almost become names, are vestiges of a bygone feudal era. Are we still a middle-aged monarchy? No! The Turkish nation is modern and must free itself from all traces of backwardness!\n\nHowever, these titles are very important in society and are highly integrated among both military and civilian personnel. They denote the prestige of an individual. Stripping these titles away from the people that earned them will surely make them everything but happy and content with the government. Should we really risk alienating this prestigious class?"

By now the heirs of the House of Osman have become the 'Shadow of God on Earth'. This title radiates throughout the Muslim world, giving the Ottoman Empire international legitimacy and respect from Muslims around the world. The Caliph has the power to rule the Muslim religion and its fatwas. Since the artifacts of Prophet Mohammed are stored in our capital [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], no other usurper can legitimately claim the title of Caliph.\n\nHowever, it seems that this title is no longer respected. Politicians no longer hesitate to challenge the Caliph, the jihad proclaimed during the Weltkrieg remained almost silent and the Arab Muslim countries decided to dismantle the seat of our once glorious and unmatched Caliphate. Kemal's secret project, the hardest to reveal, was to abolish the Caliphate completely and to remove all remaining references to the Ottoman Empire in the Turkish state he wanted to establish. This move would mark a major turning point in the future of our nation and the entire Muslim world. Still, the Caliph could remain a symbolic figurehead without political power, entirely separate from the state. However, seeing how this move would more or less entirely secularise our state, the Traditionalists will likely be greatly angered by it and try everything in their power to stop us from making the Gazi's dream come true."

 tur.26.d: "The Ottoman language is a mixture of Arabic and Persian. It is composed of hundreds of character variants and often seems very complicated to learn. This is why it contributes to the very low literacy rate the Empire suffered from since its foundation. Moreover, with modern technologies such as the press and the telegram, the weaknesses of our language became even more apparent, since these inventions can hardly be used when having to account for hundreds of different symbols. Kemal had promised in his diary that if he came to power he would do his best to reform and make the nation speak a new Turkish language within three months. Since the nineteenth century, many scientists and professors have been advocating the adoption of the Latin alphabet, an idea which Kemal also supported. Even though some Turkish words would have to be modified because of their complexity, adopting the Latin script will make it easier to learn to write and read Turkish texts and will make our language more attractive to foreigners."

This widely accepted theory further demonstrates why the Turkish nation is so determined and combative. After so many wars and centuries of confrontation against nations sometimes much more powerful than us, we are still here. We are responsible for the fall of two Roman empires and all the Arab kingdoms. All of Europe once trembled when hearing our name.

 tur.28.d: "A sheikh and a few muftis, who were unhappy with the current secularistic policy of the empire, launched an insurrection in a small town near Ankara, hoping to ignite a flame that would sooner or later become a raging fire and devour the progressive politicians responsible for the anti-religious policies of the state. These agitators managed to gather nearly a thousand people who supported their views and formed a procession. Waving the green colours of Islam, they proclaimed the restoration of the Shariah. After the mob killed two municipal officials and a young commander of the local garrison who tried to stop the procession from advancing further, the army dispersed the crowd and took the Sheikh and the most vocal protesters prisoners. After hearing of the event, Ismet was furious. He ordered the construction of a memorial in order to honour the soldier that gave his life trying to stop the insurrection and decided to punish the population of the town. While some of them were sentenced to spend the next years of their lives in prison, others were forced to pay huge fines or placed under house arrest."

 tur.29.t: "The Nationalisation Question"
 tur.29.d: "Many modern and populist ideologies embrace nationalisation as an economic solution. By forcibly nationalising or buying up most of the nation's vital factories, these states separate themselves from liberalism completely. Some extremes in the party already stated their support for the implementation of this radical solution in Turkey. Recep Peker has claimed to defend the motion and has more or less become the leader of the nationalist wing of the party. He even advocates an alliance with some Kadro ideologues, who by many are considered extremists.\n\nModerates like Ismet would prefer to stay with the original plan and nationalise only companies with too much foreign capital by buying them out. Should the extremist wing of the party manage to push through its demands, this could give a lot of confidence to Recep Peker, a protégé of Kemal, and the Kadro, a dark ideological group."

 tur.30.d: "By now, more than a third of the People's Party members have joined the nationalist wing, which has grown very attached to the ideas of the Kadroists, a group of individuals wanting to save Turkey from the liberal politicians. Seeing the party split in two under his leadership, Ismet decided to retreat from politics and resign from the post of president, thinking that he has failed his dear friend Kemal. Thereafter, the party voted on who should become Ismet's successor. A clear majority chose Kemal's young protégé, Recep Peker. The latter, the de facto leader of the nationalist wing, proclaimed the beginning of a new era for Turkey and promised to succeed where the Moderates failed.\n\nFollowing his rise to power, Peker concluded an official alliance with the Kadroists and integrated them into the nationalist wing of the party, which was then renamed into the 'Kadroist wing'. The Kadroists are interested in the extremist movements of countries close to totalism and communism, and argue that in order to save the country from its unstable political situation and the Weltkrieg, they'll have to draw inspiration from these extremes and use them in accordance with Kemalism. In practice, this means that they'll introduce great social reforms and combine them with a populist and nationalist economic policy. The Turkish revolution has begun!"
 tur.30.a: "我们需要拯救土耳其！"
 tur.31.t: "不断革命"
 tur.31.d: "《骨干》杂志的理论家谢夫凯特·叙雷亚·艾德迈尔与法利赫·勒夫克曾多次访问欧洲，特别还是参加过法国的极权主义大会，工团主义者在大会上敦促他们帮助凯末尔将土耳其从德意志-穆斯林帝国主义中解放出来。他们借口马克思主义意识形态的缺陷使其无法在土耳其生效，内心则渴望与这种意识形态区分，但他们从不否认自己深受其启发。此外，骨干派诗人哈姆杜拉·苏普希在他的一首诗中赞扬了墨索里尼和莫斯利这两位极权主义运动的巨擘。随着极端民族主义与民粹主义的结合越发紧密，骨干体制可能最终会同意与马克思主义联系起来，以便为土耳其开辟新的外交机会，与新兴的联盟第三国际搭上线，特别是与其中的发展中国家和“第三世界”国家搞好关系。土耳其地处欧洲、非洲和亚洲之交，加入这个革命联盟定然十分合适。"
 tur.31.a: "凯末尔主义思想不得被马克思主义侵蚀！"
 tur.31.b: "把革命进行到底！"
 tur.32.t: "费夫齐·恰克马克执掌大权"
 tur.32.d: "Following the passing of the law prohibiting any active military member of the People's Party from running for political office and their expulsion from parliament, many military officers were incensed and argued that this was unacceptable. Among them was one of Kemal's friends and chief of staff, Fevzi Çakmak. However, the government did not foresee the setback this would have on the stability of the country. With the creation of an independent army and the disorder this measure created, many Traditionalists organised simultaneous attacks and killed a few hundred people in order to underline their demands for political conservatism. This created popular indignation, with some calling the Mareşal for help. [TUR.GetLeader], not knowing what else to do, called his old friend Fevzi back, promising him emergency powers and the revocation of the law separating military and politics if he fought back against the Traditionalists.\n\nFevzi used his newfound powers to establish a military government and declared martial law in the most conservative provinces. With the military once again under government control, he managed to arrest several members of the organised Islamist groups responsible for the attacks. The Mareşal and his victories were acclaimed by large crowds in the streets of most major cities. Arguing that he is the only one that can save the Turkish people form their self-destruction, the Mareşal decided to keep his current powers and to take over the position of president. In a speech, he promised the people to step in the footsteps of Mustafa Kemal and to guide them into a glorious future."
 tur.32.a: "希望元帅能够拯救土耳其人民。"
 tur.33.t: "Modern Soldier Training"
 tur.33.d: "With the creation of a new army with new training methods, we can focus our soldiers and their training on specific combat styles. They have to be ready for the wars to come, no matter where the battlefields may lay and no matter who they will have to fight against.\n\nTurkey is at the crossroad of three continents, lying between Asia, Europe and Africa. Because of this, we are surrounded by all types of terrain and climatic environments, from the steppes, over the mountains of the Caucasus, to the deserts of Sinai and Iraq. Therefore, it would make sense to focus our training methods on adapting our soldiers to all the different environments they may have to fight in.\n\nHowever, modern battles also rely on speed and swiftness. Kemal was a fan of mobile warfare and preferred to use cavalry in his strategies. With the evolution of technology, we can continue his plans and even go a step further by replacing horses with tanks and motorised equipment."
 tur.33.a: "They have to be able to adapt to every situation!"
 tur.33.b: "We should focus on the modern cavalry, which was dear to Kemal."
 tur.34.t: "Status of the Army"
 tur.34.d: "The question of the status of the army is a rather delicate one. Due to the military attachment of the Turkish people, many nationalists and party members are also high-ranking military officials. For example, famous politicians like Ismet, Recep and Kemal were all part of the military at some point. Also, there are people like Fevzi and Fahrettin, who are still serving in the military despite their political commitment. However, as we noticed during the HIF period, the presence of the army can lead to coups against the government in place if the political situation is not to its liking, which was quite useful in bringing the OHF to power. Nevertheless, with the Kemalist reforms and the resistance they've sparked, an intervention of the military would be less than ideal.\n\nWe have to make a decision: We could either leave the army under the control of the government and maintain the status quo, or we could separate it completely from politics by forbidding military personnel to hold political positions. Obviously, this could make some of our officers unhappy, but ultimately it would hopefully help to secure the government from military coups."
 tur.34.a: "The army should be independent from politics."
 tur.34.b: "The army must remain under the control of the government."
 tur.35.t: "[TUR.GetName]请求加入帝国公约"
 tur.35.d: "After being defeated by the Cairo Pact and suffering from internal struggles for quite some time, the Turks recently managed to stabilise their nation. Hoping to once again play a role on the world stage, they've asked us if they could join the Reichspakt and fight side by side with us once more. Them joining our faction would certainly help us against the Russians, since the Turks could threaten the Caucasus and block the entrance to the Black Sea. It should also be considered that the Turks supported us in our struggle against half the world a few decades back, so why shouldn't we support them now?"

 tur.42.d: "Those dastardly Turks have sent our government an ultimatum: Either we return all provinces which had been a part of the Ottoman Empire before the Desert War to their rule, or we shall 'face the consequences'. Today, our government will have to decide if our new territories, which rightfully belong to the Greek nation according to the Megali Idea, are something worth fighting and dying for. Even though refusing the ultimatum could lead to another war against the Turks, we have to consider how far we have come already. The Turks are now longer what they used to be, and our nation is now more powerful than ever before. For the first time in centuries, we might actually have a chance if we were to stand up against our Muslim neighbours - even if this potential victory would probably come at a great cost."

Finally, the Turks, whose families have been living in these provinces for generations now, are no longer oppressed by an openly hostile regime.

 tur.44.d: "The Greek bastards refused to hand over the territories they have stolen from us after our defeat in the Desert War.

 tur.46.t: "土耳其想要追回黎凡特"
 tur.46.d: "After we defeated the Ottoman Empire in the Desert War, the Turkish military was broken and their nation destabilised. However, it appears that we didn't wreck them enough. The Turks have managed to recover and are now trying to reclaim the Arab territories formerly held by the Ottoman Empire, arguing that they still have a righteous claim on these lands. Even though this is clearly false, [TUR.GetLeader] deemed this claim legitimate enough to present us with an ultimatum: Either we spit on the Syrian soldiers that left their lives fighting for the freedom of the Arab people and cede Syria to the Turks, or we stand up and fight against the Turkish oppressors once more. No matter how we decide, we should choose quickly, since Turkish troops are already massing on our border - and growing more impatient by the day."

 tur.49.d: "Before the Desert War, the grand city of Mosul had a sizeable Turkish population. However, after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, many Turks began migrating to Anatolia, fearing that they would otherwise face oppression and discrimination under the new Arab regime. The government of [TUR.GetNameDef] has now decided to use this exodus to their advantage. They claim that the stream of refugees shows that we aren't treating our Turkish citizens properly, and have thus requested us to cede the city of Mosul and its surrounding territories to them. Should we not comply, the Turks noted that they won't hesitate to use force to accomplish their goals. Even though most countries around us support our claim on Mosul, it may be a wise decision not to escalate the tensions and to just give in to the Turkish demands. However, we could also try to launch a preemptive strike. This would hopefully allow us to catch the Turkish troops offguard and demoralise the Turkish army before it can strike our territory."

 tur.52.t: "博斯普鲁斯会晤"
 tur.52.d: "This afternoon, King Edward VIII, on a visit to a member country of the Entente, stopped his yacht in the Bosporus. Mustafa Kemal, probably already awaiting the King, visited him on his boat not long thereafter. Seeing how smoothly it all went, the entire occurrence seems to have been planned in advance. Some journalists were even able to capture unique images of the Gazi in his swimming suit chatting happily with the King of England. No one knows what the true meaning of this meeting was, which sparked some speculations: While most people think that this was nothing but a friendly visit, showing that there's no longer any bad blood between the British and the Turks, others argued that this event could be the first step towards a Turkish entry into the Entente, a political move which could potentially bring Turkey back on the world stage."
 tur.52.a: "A sign of future cooperation?"
 tur.53.t: "Speech on National Sovereignty"
 tur.53.d: "This morning, at the opening of the assembly, Ismet gave an opening speech about national sovereignty: \"This event constitutes the most tangible proof of the living capacity of our people. Our history is rich in such miracles. Throughout their existence, our people have known lots of setbacks. Sometimes, it even seemed as if the entire world was against us. However, the Turkish people managed to stand up and stand strong again, no matter how hard these setbacks were. These people who yesterday were thought to be doomed to disappear rise up today. Our people have formed a significant empire on the Anatolian lands under the aegis of the children of Ertugrul. It has been the dedicated defender of the Islamic cause. Every time our people have been confronted with any disorder, they've managed to save themselves by creating new institutions and by showing the world their strength.\"\n\nAfter the speech was over and the thunderous applause died down, Ismet and other leading party officials began discussing the future of the nation and drawing up plans to save Turkey and its people."
 tur.53.a: "Selam olsun!"
 tur.54.t: "Abolition of the Achar"
 tur.54.d: "Today, the assembly voted for an important and symbolic reform: the \"abolition of the Achar\", i.e. the tithe. \"The achar is a nightmare for our peasants and farmers,\" said [TUR.GetLeader], who has made its abolition a national priority, arguing that there cannot be progress while parts of our population are still forced to live hand to mouth. Unfortunately, this tax, which is levied in kind at a rate of more than one tenth of production, is not only a source of happiness for the farmers-general and usurers, but also the Republic's main budgetary revenue. It must have taken considerable courage to even consider this reform, seeing how the economy of the nation is already suffering and the military uses up big parts of the available budget. Whilst many people, especially those living in poverty, are more than happy with this reform, some remain sceptical and are wondering how [TUR.GetLeader] plans to cover the nation's expenses from now on."
 tur.54.a: "Turkish peasants are cheering!"
 tur.55.t: "“帽子”演讲"
 tur.55.d: "A few days ago, Ismet Reşit gave a speech in the city of Inebolu near Kastamonu. In it, he stressed the importance of a new national dress code that could highlight the elegance of the Turkish people. He said: 'Does it make sense to daub a very precious jewel with mud? If there is a jewel inside the mud then we need to wipe away the mud in order to reveal the jewel; this is only natural and necessary. We shall wear Oxford shoes or alternately, ankle shoes from now on; and trousers, waistcoats, shirts, ties, removable collars, jackets and most naturally, hats.' The last piece of clothing on this list, the hats, seemed to be of particular importance for him. Ismet even went as far as to advocate the creation of a new law which would make it mandatory for all men to wear western-style hats in public places, basically forbidding the traditional turban and fez. By now, this speech has been published in most major newspapers and has been dubbed 'The Hat Speech'.\n\nEven though the law Ismet fantasised about has not yet been enacted, there have been some protests in eastern Anatolia against the idea of an enforced western clothing style. However, these were quickly silenced and the majority of the country is ready to embrace a new look."

 tur.58.a: "It appears even fellow socialists can be savages..."
 tur.59.t: "Sultan Osman and Mustafa Kemal Killed!"
 tur.59.d: "Today, shortly after noon, a sudden explosion shook the city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The blast came from the palace of our beloved Sultan Osman, who at the time was meeting with Grand Vizier Musta Kemal Pasha to discuss how the government should proceed now that the Empire had been shattered and crushed. Without notice nor warning, these discussions came to an early end when a hidden bomb exploded, wrecking the front of the palace and leaving bystanders in shock. Fearing for the life of their Sultan, nearby observers rushed to help, but it was all in vain. Among the debris, only the disfigured bodies of Osman, the Grand Vizier, and members of the palace guard could be found.\n\nNaturally, the untimely demise of the Sultan meant chaos. The news spread quickly, first throughout the city and then throughout the entire nation. Upon hearing of the Sultan's death, Refet Pasha decided to take his chances. Stating his fear of an imminent collapse of the nation into anarchy as the reason, he rallied the most important politicians of the opposition and the majority of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s garrison around him and marched towards the major government buildings of the city, taking control of them within the span of a few hours. The general confusion and uncertainty following the Sultan's demise prevented the remaining government officials from organising much of a resistance, and subsequently, the coup was over just as quickly as it had begun. With his position secured, Refet Pasha declared himself the new Head of State and the Ottoman Salvation Party the new government, and stated that he aims to use his powers to secure law and order in the nation and to find the terrorists responsible for the Sultan's death.\n\nHowever, this riddle might prove hard to solve, as the police have thus far found no clues that might lead to the traitors. People have, however, already started throwing wild accusations around, with some blaming Kurdish or Armenian nationalists, whilst others have even denounced Refet Pasha himself. Sadly, it seems likely that the truth is never going to be revealed."
 tur.59.a: "We weep for our Sultan and our Pasha."
 tur.60.t: "Fevzi Takes Power"
 tur.60.d: "The defeat in the Desert War was the most devastating catastrophe our nation had to experience in a very long time. We were forced to concede almost all of our non-Turkish territories, thousands of men lost their lives and even more their homes. Naturally, this led to the people losing trust in their government and especially in the capabilities of the armed forces. However, many high-ranking officers don't think that the army is at fault, shifting the entire blame to the liberal government instead. According to them, the HIF neglected the army and didn't pursue an efficient defence policy, resulting in the downfall of our once great Empire.\n\nFearing that the liberals won't be able to get the nation out of its spiral of tragedies and disasters, Field Marshal Fevzi Pasha, one of the most respected officers of our armed forces, decided to no longer sit by idly. He rallied a few politicians of the OHF around him, gathered a group of supporting officers and mobilised soldiers loyal to his cause. Then, he marched on to the centre of [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where he surrounded the liberal government. Once the HIF politicians realised that they had no realistic chance of resisting Fevzi's troops, they surrendered to the Mareşal, who then arrested them for \"treason against the Empire and its people\". After the liberals had been dealt with, Fevzi declared himself the new Head of State. Not long after the coup had concluded, he gave a speech, which was broadcasted to the entire nation over the radio. In it, he informed the people of the change in politics and assured them that from now on, their voices would be heard, and that under his lead, our nation would return to its former glory.\n\nEven though the people admire Fevzi for his military achievements, many still question his ability to govern the nation efficiently. Seeing how Fevzi was once a dear friend of Kemal, some also fear that his coup will mean a return to the policies of the OHF - which are dreaded by some parts of the population. Only time will tell if the fears and uncertainties of the people are justified..."
 tur.60.a: "Let's see what the future will bring."
 tur.61.t: "The Enemy Reveals Itself"
 tur.61.d: "When he took power, the Mareşal promised that he'd use his powers to secure the continued survival of our nation and to fight the enemies of the state. Until now, it has been left deliberately unclear who exactly these enemies are, but today, Fevzi decided to answer this question in a speech.\n\n\"When I look at the Empire, I see a once great nation that has been utterly destroyed by its enemies. And I see these enemies kicking our state while it's already down. My Turkish friends, you might be asking yourselves: 'Who are these enemies you are seeing?' Well, this is a question I will gladly answer. The first enemy I can see is the liberal opposition to my rule. Many of the idiotic members of the former HIF still haven't realised that it was their system that led to the downfall of the Empire - and that their system would mean the total nullification of any chance our nation still has to return to its former glory. This is why I will fight these liberal pigs with everything I have until their brains are finally freed of the leftist poison. But, this is not all. I see another enemy. One that has emerged after our defeat in the Desert War. This enemy is our current economic situation. It prevents us from reaching the prosperity and peace all of us desire. We cannot grow if our economy is destroyed and our production rate minuscule. We'll have to rebuild our economy before we can start thinking about anything else.\"\n\nWith these words, Fevzi has made his priorities clear. Now, all that remains to be seen is how he will go about defeating the enemies that he has now revealed, and if the population agrees with this new enemy image."
 tur.61.a: "He has quite the task ahead of him."
 tur.62.t: "费夫齐，国家救星"
 tur.62.d: "In the midst of the chaos of the aftermath of the Desert War, one man decided to take action. One man decided to pursue any actions he deemed necessary to ensure the continued survival of our nation. This man was Fevzi Pasha. By taking over the government, which is still regarded as a highly questionable, if not outright criminal, move by some, he was able to take control of the nation's rebuilding process. Although leading the completion of said process was without a doubt not an easy task, it presented Fevzi with an opportunity to reshape the state in accordance with his own visions - and he did not hesitate to use this opportunity to the fullest. However, in order to achieve this goal, he first saw himself forced to crack down on those standing in his way, which led to him being perceived by many as a \"ruler with an iron fist\".\n\nEven so, now that the dust has settled and stability has returned to the realm, most people appear to agree that the benefits brought by the Mareşal's rule outweigh the harm he has done. Throughout the country, the opposition voices are slowly growing ever more quiet, and it seems like the population is growing increasingly content with their new government, with some even calling the Mareşal the \"saviour of the Turkish nation\". With the day-to-day lives of the Turkish people slowly but surely returning to normal, hopes are high that the new era of Turkish prosperity and prestige Fevzi has promised is about to begin."
 tur.62.a: "我们为元帅鼓掌！"
 tur.63.t: "The Mareşal Reinstates the Parliament"
 tur.63.d: "Keeping true to his promises, the Mareşal has decided not to abuse his emergency powers to centralise the entire authority around himself, but to reinstate the Turkish parliament instead. However, Fevzi was nevertheless unwilling to resign from his current position as Head of State, leading him to establish a more controlled form of democracy with himself at the top. Despite these drawbacks, this move has at least partially satisfied many supporters of a multi-party system. Seeing how the THF is not the only electable party in the upcoming legislative election, our citizens have high hopes that it will bring some much needed fresh air and a few new faces into the political scene of our nation.\n\nStill, considering how many people trust the Mareşal deeply and how he still holds on to much of his powers, it can be assumed that the THF will likely keep its majority in the parliament. Thus, this election probably won't change too much politically, but will first and foremost serve as a way to legitimise Fevzi's rule and his decision to keep his current position."
 tur.63.a: "A step in the right direction."
 tur.64.t: "Fevzi's Lies Exposed"
 tur.64.d: "After the Mareşal reinstated the parliament, the people were quite content with the new democratic system. However, this has changed now that a scandal has rocked the nation.\n\nA few times by now, the Mareşal has been spotted together with some of the leaders of the opposition parties. Of course, this would have been nothing out of the ordinary if it had been during a political debate in parliament. However, he and his political opponents were seen walking through [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where they were probably on their way to Fevzi's home in the centre of the city. According to the reports of the citizens that saw them, it appears that they are, in fact, not fierce political opponents, but rather the dearest of friends. Some people even reported this to the major newspapers - and they didn't hesitate before getting to work on a new article. Now, newspapers with headlines such as \"Fevzi's lies exposed!\" are selling like hot cakes all across the country.\n\nNaturally, this scandal has sparked quite the controversy. Some people are trying to defend Fevzi, arguing that it's normal for a man like him to have good relations even with political enemies and that this news doesn't change anything about the sacrifices he has made for the nation and the people. Furthermore, there are also some doubting the trustworthiness of the reports, as none of the witnesses could provide any pictures of the incident and the newspapers were probably just looking for a good-selling story. On the other hand, there's also a sizeable portion of our population confident that these reports are evidence enough of Fevzi's ambitions to undermine the democracy he's officially been trying to preserve. Now they've started asking themselves: Has Fevzi been working against democracy? Has he been building a kingdom of hypocrisy this entire time? And, most importantly, does he really do everything in his power to defend the common folk?\nSadly, only the Mareşal himself knows the answers to these questions."
 tur.64.a: "A shocking scandal - or just panicmongering?"
 tur.65.t: "Proclamation of the Turkish Republic"
 tur.65.d: "Today, the Mareşal gave a speech, in which he officially announced the birth of the Türkiye Cumhuriyeti, the Republic of Turkey. In his speech, Fevzi said: \"We are no longer Ottomans. We have lost the Desert War and with it our claim to the title 'Ottoman'. We have to let the past die. We shall no longer look to it in awe. We shall look to the future and try to make the best of our current situation, which isn't as bad as it may seem at first glance. Though we have lost much of our former glory, our nation is more united than ever before. All across the country, Turkish hearts beat in unison. It is those hearts that the nation should belong to, which is why I hereby proclaim the Republic of Turkey!\"\n\nAfter this part of his speech, the Mareşal spoke about his plans for the future. About the industrial advances Turkey would experience under his rule, about the possible establishment of a democratic system, and about his goal of regaining the respect of the nations around us.\n\nThough the more liberal parts of our population nevertheless question Fevzi's wish to establish a real democracy, the speech and news were overall received quite well by the majority of our citizens, and Turks all across the country hope that this day marks the beginning of a new era of Turkish sovereignty, peace, and stability."
 tur.65.a: "A new era begins!"
 tur.66.t: "Fear of the Religious Community"
 tur.66.d: "Unsurprisingly, considering the secularistic policy Kemal and his followers pursued, seeing the OHF, nowadays known as the THF, once again rise to power sparked fear in the ranks of the religious orders. While the leaders of these orders are mostly afraid of losing their political influence and riches, they are also concerned about the possibility of the nation disregarding the traditional values of Islam and fear that Islamic pratices may be expelled from the day-to-day lives of the Turkish people. To counter this possible development, some of the orders already organised protests against the THF government and have requested the support of all \"true Muslims\" in their struggle against secularisation. However, because the majority of the people still stand behind [TUR.GetLeader], these protests have thus far stayed small in scale and the calls of their leaders only been answered by a few diehard conservatives. Nevertheless, it would probably be a wise idea to try and calm the orders before they use their influence to expand their demonstrations."
 tur.66.a: "Their fear is unreasonable, right?"
 tur.67.t: "Turkey, Vanguard of Stability and Modernisation"
 tur.67.d: "After all the hard work done by [TUR.GetLeader] and his government, Turkey can now truly be considered the vanguard of stability and modernisation. Turkey has a formal and written constitution, first elections have taken place, and the people are generally content and place trust in their government and their leader. No longer should [TUR.GetNameDef] be considered inferior to the nations of the west. Even if the governments of these countries don't like to admit it, we have even surpassed some of them when it comes to the implementation of civil rights and modernisation in general. We have become a shining beacon in the Middle East, a sign of hope and an icon of a brighter future. Hopefully, other nations, especially our Arabian neighbours, will follow our lead."
 tur.67.a: "The future begins now!"
 tur.68.t: "亚历山大勒塔之问"
 tur.68.d: "In the aftermath of the Desert War, the province of Iskenderun, also known as Alexandretta, was stolen from us by the Syrians. This region has been a part of the Ottoman Empire for about 400 years prior to its annexation by the Syrians and has a population that is mainly made up of Turks, making the loss of the province even more painful. Many political parties, especially the nationalists, still consider Iskenderun a rightful part of Anatolia, and thus advocate for its reintegration into [TUR.GetNameDef]. To achieve this goal, we'd have to remind the Turks living in the area of their allegiance to our state and bring them to put pressure on the Syrian government. This will force the Syrians to either accept the will of the people and let the Turks of Alexandretta rejoin our nation, or reveal their vile and imperialistic ambitions to the world, giving us a justification to take back Iskenderun by force."
 tur.68.a: "我们必须统一人民！"
 tur.69.t: "Our Relations with the New Iraqi State"
 tur.69.d: "After our defeat in the Desert War, new nations arose in the entire Middle East. Among them was the young nation of Iraq, which had been a part of the Ottoman Empire since it had been conquered by Sultan Selim I in 1534. Naturally, after such a long time, the province grew quite close to Kostantiniyye. Because of this, Iraq, unlike other Arab nations, does not hate us with every fibre of their being. This gives us the opportunity to reestablish diplomatic relations with the young state and allows us to fight the influence the Egyptians have over the most eastern part of the Arab world. Conveniently, this would also give us access to the rich Iraqi oil fields and thus help boost our economy. Seeing how the Iraqis are being threatened by the Iranians, who view Iraq as an integral part of their nation, they surely wouldn't say no to a new friend in the region that could possibly help in the defence of their homeland."
 tur.69.a: "Let's hope the Iraqis will accept our reconcilement."
 tur.70.t: "Iskenderun Votes for Secession"
 tur.70.d: "A few days ago, we demanded the organisation of a referendum concerning the status of the province of Iskenderun. The goal of said referendum was to let the people decide if they want to stay a part of [SYR.GetNameDef], or if they rather want to become a part of our glorious nation once again. Surprisingly, it appears that the regional government of Iskenderun has decided to accept our request, probably thinking that the people of Alexandretta have been indoctrinated enough by the [SYR.GetAdjective] regime to think that they'd be better off upholding the current status quo.\n\nToday, the referendum was finally held and the votes were counted. The result - an overwhelming majority of Iskenderun's population voted for secession, and thus voiced their wish to reunite with our state. Whilst this was to be expected, seeing as the province is still predominantly inhabited by Turks that feel attached to [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it's still good to see that the [SYR.GetAdjective] government has not yet managed to corrupt their minds. Now we shall wait and see if our neighbours accept this result, or if they want to contest it."
 tur.70.a: "Let's hope the [SYR.GetAdjective] government accepts this."
 tur.71.t: "Iskenderun Votes for Secession"
 tur.71.d: "Earlier this week, a referendum was held in the province of Iskenderun, also known as Alexandretta. The referendum was an initiative of the Turks, who still haven't gotten over their defeat in the Desert War. However, instead of trying to regain control of the province by force, the Turks decided to give the citizens of Iskenderun the right to self-determination. The goal of the referendum was to let the people decide if they want to stay a part of our nation or become a part of [TUR.GetNameDef] instead.\n\nOnce the votes were finally counted, it became apparent that the Turks had poisoned the minds of our people with far greater efficiency than we initially thought. With an overwhelming majority, the population of Iskenderun voted to secede from our country and thus demanded the reintegration of the province into [TUR.GetNameDef]. Of course, it is up to us to decide if we want to accept the results of this obviously rigged election and lead the people of Alexandretta to their certain doom, or if we want to ignore the referendum and uphold our control of the province. However, the latter approach could be used by the Turks to justify a new war, which would surely cause many unnecessary deaths. How should we decide?"
 tur.71.a: "We'll listen to the people."
 tur.71.b: "We shall keep the province."
 tur.72.t: "Iskenderun Votes to Stay"
 tur.72.d: "Earlier this week, a referendum was held in the province of Iskenderun, also known as Alexandretta. The referendum was an initiative of the Turks, who still haven't gotten over their defeat in the Desert War. However, instead of trying to regain control of the province by force, the Turks decided to give the citizens of Iskenderun the right to self-determination. The goal of the referendum was to let the people decide if they want to stay a part of our nation or become a part of [TUR.GetNameDef] instead.\n\nOnce the votes were finally counted, it became apparent that the people of Alexandretta had realised that we aren't as bad as the [TUR.GetAdjective] government claims us to be. With an overwhelming majority, the population of Iskenderun voted to stay a part of our country - showing the Turks that they are no longer wanted in the province. This must have hit the Turks hard, considering they were the ones to advocate the referendum, thinking it would surely result in the people voting for secession. On the other hand, our rule over Iskenderun has now been legitimised, meaning that from now on no other country can contest our ownership of the region without violating the right of men to self-determination."
 tur.72.a: "This should settle the matter."
 tur.74.t: "Iskenderun Votes to Stay"
 tur.74.d: "A few days ago, we demanded the organisation of a referendum concerning the status of the province of Iskenderun. The goal of said referendum was to let the people decide if they want to stay a part of [SYR.GetNameDef], or if they rather want to become a part of our glorious nation once again.

The result - a majority of voters chose to stay a part of [SYR.GetNameDef]. This of course cannot be true, seeing as the province is still predominantly inhabited by Turks that feel attached to [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Somehow, the [SYR.GetAdjective] government must have rigged the referendum. By doing this, our neighbours have shown the world that they don't give a damn about the people's right to self-determination. However, we shall not let ourselves be tricked this easily, and will not back down until Iskenderun returns to our righteous rule!"
 tur.74.a: "This is outrageous!"
 tur.75.t: "Iskenderun Joins our Nation!"
 tur.75.d: "At long last, we finally managed to reunite with our Turkish brethren in Iskenderun! Our efforts to remind the people of their allegiance to [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have paid off and helped inspire the Turkish population of the region to revolt against the Syrian government. Caught offguard by the quickly growing civil unrest, the local administration had no choice but to accept the wish of the people to reintegrate the province into [TUR.GetNameDef]. The fact that many local gouverneurs are also of Turkish descent and thus sympathised with the unification movement only facilitated this process. Now we shall wait and see how the Syrians react to us reclaiming our rightful territory."
 tur.75.a: "Reunited at last!"
 tur.76.t: "Iskenderun Secedes from our Nation!"
 tur.76.d: "The dastardly Turkish bastards have secretly been working on propaganda campaigns to persuade the population of Iskenderun into revolting against us. Sadly, the people of the region failed to use their brains and fell victim to the blatant lies told by the Turks. Their minds poisoned, they pressured the local government into accepting the secession of Alexandretta and the reintegration of the region into [TUR.GetNameDef]. The government in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has already declared this event a \"deserved victory of the Turkish people\", however, the tale doesn't have to end here. We still have the option to fight back, but if we hesitate now, we may never have a chance to recover our rightful territory ever again."
 tur.76.a: "How dare they?!"
 tur.76.b: "There's nothing we can do about it..."
 tur.77.t: "土耳其想要重建关系"
 tur.77.d: "Today, an envoy from [TUR.GetNameDef] arrived in our capital. Apparently, the Turks don't have any hard feelings because of our secession from the empire. Instead, they want to reestablish diplomatic relations between our countries, saying that even now that our two states have been parted, we should work together to ensure the safety and prosperity of our people. Seeing how the Persians are eyeing up our land, it might be a wise idea to get a new friend on our side that could help us defend our homeland and maybe even scare the Persians away. However, some fear that the Turks might be trying to diplomatically isolate us from our Arab allies and thus make us dependant on [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], both economically and militarily. How should we respond to the Turkish offer?"
 tur.77.a: "让我们共同步入未来！"
 tur.77.b: "我们不需要他们！"
 tur.78.t: "伊拉克拒绝！"
 tur.78.d: "The Iraqis refused our diplomatic approachment, fearing that our intentions are not as pure as they may seem and that we might be planning something behind our back. Although this is of course not the case, there's nothing we can do about it right now. Sadly, it appears that trying to foster a friendship between Arabs and Turks is an impossible endeavour."
 tur.78.a: "吃亏的是他们。"
 tur.79.t: "伊拉克接受！"
 tur.79.d: "It appears that the people of Iraq are still as wise as they were in ancient times, seeing how they decided to accept our diplomatic approachment, citing that a friendship between our two countries would benefit us both. Now we shall march on together - for a brighter future!"
 tur.79.a: "愿我们的合作能带来繁荣！"
 tur.80.t: "Turkish State Visit"
 tur.80.d: "Today, [TUR.GetLeader] paid our nation an official state visit, which had been planned and organised for quite a while now. After he arrived at an airport near [IRQ.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where he was greeted by a 21-gun salute, an ambassador led him and his personal guards into the heart of the capital, where [IRQ.GetLeader] was already waiting. While they drove through the streets of the city, many people came out of their houses to take a look at our guest of honour, cheering happily as he drove by. The meeting between the two heads of state began with the exchanging of gifts: [TUR.GetLeader] brought a nazar-amulet, some Turkish delight and a few valuable Turkish carpets, while [IRQ.GetLeader] gifted his new Turkish friend a small collection of ancient coins, which have been found in the region of Mesopotamia. After that, a state dinner was held, in which only the most magnificent Iraqi meals were served. Afterwards, the two visited a military graveyard, where [TUR.GetLeader] laid a wreath as a symbolic gesture, applauding the bravery of the Iraqi soldiers.\n\nAs the day came to an end, it was about time for [TUR.GetLeader] to get back to the airport. On the way there, he and [IRQ.GetLeader] chatted happily, as if they were old friends that had known each other for years now. However, all good things must end eventually, and so [TUR.GetLeader] boarded his plane, looked back one last time, and began his trip back to [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 tur.80.a: "We wish him a good home trip!"
 tur.81.t: "The Turks Recognise our Independence"
 tur.81.d: "Now that diplomatic relations between our two countries have formally been restored, the next logical step was for the Turks to officially recognise us as an independent nation. By doing this, they also renounced any claims they still had on our territory and accepted our ownership of the former Ottoman provinces. Even though most of the Arab nations already recognised us and do not care about what the Turks say, this move strengthened the legitimacy of our government in the eyes of the rest of the world and thus also helped increase our diplomatic weight on a global level."
 tur.81.a: "Wonderful!"
 tur.82.t: "土耳其-伊拉克经济协定"
 tur.82.d: "A few days ago, representatives of the [TUR.GetAdjective] government met a few deputies of our government in Baghdad to discuss the possibility of an economic accord. The goal of said accord was to increase the prosperity of our two nations by encouraging trade across our borders. The negotiations were relatively short and resulted in a treaty that formally abolished tariffs on goods being transported between our two nations, as well as reducing border controls in order to unburden the flow of goods. Most importantly, this treaty will give us easier access to the Turkish minerals, while the Turks will benefit from our oil fields."
 tur.82.a: "A truly wonderful arrangement!"
 tur.83.t: "Turkish-Iraqi Mutual Protection Treaty"
 tur.83.d: "With global and regional tensions rising, one needs allies if he wants to survive the century. Cause of this, the [TUR.GetAdjective] government proposed the signing of a mutual protection treaty between our two nations. Seeing how this would secure us another layer of protection against the threats currently breathing down our neck, [IRQ.GetLeader] didn't have to think long before he accepted the proposal. Hopefully, this will ensure the safety of our people and deter other nations from attacking us or our new Turkish friends."
 tur.83.a: "For a safe future!"
 tur.84.t: "[TUR.GetNameDef]宣称萨洛尼卡！"
 tur.84.d: "Using the state of war between our two countries, the Turks have expanded their war aims even further, to now include [989.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as well. Claiming that they need to 'reclaim the Home of the Revolution' from us, they are now laying claim not only to the city, but the surrounding regions as well, trying to return to a state of affairs from before the Weltkrieg."
 tur.84.a: "It is all or nothing now."
 tur.90.t: "Kurdish Independentist Sentiment"
 tur.90.d: "The majority of what would be considered Kurdistan has been controlled by us for about 400 years now. Nevertheless, we haven't managed to centralise the Kurdish territories because the Kurds don't see themselves as a part of [TUR.GetNameDef], pledging allegiance to their tribal chiefs instead. Despite our best efforts, we were unable to integrate them into the rest of our country and still haven't managed to supress their will to fight for their independence. Cause of this, there have been numerous Kurdish revolts before and during the Weltkrieg, which have all been beaten down by our military might. The fear of our soldiers and their cruelty was the only thing keeping the Kurds at bay - most of the time, that is.\n\nOur defeat in the Desert War and the catastrophic state our military is in right now gave the Kurds new hope. Slowly but surely, the Kurdish chiefs are beginning to settle their differences, allowing them to focus on their common enemy: [TUR.GetNameDef]. Considering our momentary weakness, a Kurdish revolt could have disastrous consequences. We'll have to react one way or another - before the Kurds see their time to strike and unite under one banner against us."
 tur.90.a: "Do they really think they can get away with this?!"
 tur.91.t: "Kurdish Situation Appeased"
 tur.91.d: "It appears that all of our efforts were not in vain. Finally, after decades, if not centuries, of the Kurds opposing our rule and ignoring our righteous claim on their land, the situation in the region seems to have stabilised. Rebel organisations were crushed and their leaders arrested, reducing the influence these agitators had on the rest of the population to a minimum. Paired with the increased police presence in major cities and on the most important roads, these measures reminded the Kurds that the Turkish people are strong, even after their defeat in the Desert War. Also, our investments in the Kurdish provinces, including literacy campaigns and the expansion of infrastructure, made the Kurds realise that we aren't as bad as some of their chiefs claim us to be. After all, if they were independent from our rule, they wouldn't have had the means needed for such programmes. Slowly but surely, they are beginning to accept that our rule is what's best for them."
 tur.91.a: "Finally, inner peace."
 tur.92.t: "库尔德起义"
 tur.92.d: "A few days ago, the Sheikhs, Aghas and Chiefs of Kurdistan met in Diyarbakir to discuss the future of their people. Initially, nobody thought that they would come to an agreement, considering how many of them were archenemies not that long ago. Surprisingly, the meeting didn't fall apart instantly. In fact, the discussion stayed relatively civil and without any unexpected incidents. It appears that they've realised that they're stronger if they fight united and under one banner - a dangerous sign. About a day after the meeting started, it became clear that the majority of the Kurdish leaders were in favour of Kurdish independence, saying that they want to free their people from their Turkish overlords. This led them to proclaim the independence of the State of Kurdistan this morning. Knowing that we'll never accept this, they immediately thereafter called the Kurds to arms, claiming that this fight will finally bring them their long-desired freedom from the \"Turkish yoke\". Thousands are heeding the call and joining the revolt against our rule. However, there are barely any experienced soldiers within the ranks of the Kurds, which consist mostly of inexperienced farmers, nomads and tribesmen. This means that our army, although not in a very good state, should have no problem dealing with this revolt. It's about time we show the Kurds their place!"
 tur.92.a: "独立！？为了库尔德人？没兴趣！"
 tur.93.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap]拒绝割让亚历山大勒塔"
 tur.93.d: "The vicious government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has elected to ignore the desires of their Turkish citizens, whose only wish was to finally be reunited with their brethren in Anatolia. This outrageous act violates the right to self-determination of the Turks of Iskenderun and thus could very well be used as a justification for military actions against the Syrian government. However, some members of our government fear that a declaration of war could lead to our demise, considering we already lost to the Syrians when they were but a group of unorganised rebels. We'll have to decide if Alexandretta is worth the hassle."
 tur.93.a: "We'll teach them a lesson!"
 tur.93.b: "Nothing we can do about it..."
 tur.94.t: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap]想要加入贝尔格莱德条约"
 tur.94.d: "Today, truly surprising news reached the capital. The Turks, after being beaten down in the Desert War, decided that they should find some new friends. This led them directly to our doorstep - and to the Turks asking to join the Belgrade Pact. Naturally, this has sparked some controversy. Many still remember the First Balkan War, a bloody conflict, which we fought together with our Balkan allies against the Turks. A glance at an even more distant past also shows the roots of some wounds that to this day haven't fully healed. During the reign of the Ottoman Empire over Serbia, the Turks didn't hesitate to crush any rebellions with an unprecedented cruelty. This, for many, is a crime that cannot be forgiven. Not today and not in the future.\n\nHowever, some others also argue that these disputes, as heavy as they may be, lie in the distant past and should thus not dictate the political development of today. They think that it's about time to bury the hatchet and look to the future not as enemies, but as brothers in arms."
 tur.94.a: "欢迎土耳其人加入条约！"
 tur.94.b: "他们以为我们能忘记他们的所作所为吗？！"
 tur.95.t: "塞尔维亚人接受了我们的请求"
 tur.95.d: "Today is an important day for the entire Balkans! [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has decided to accept our request to join the Belgrade Pact, welcoming us into the military alliance. By doing this, they've also officially forgiven us for the crimes committed against the Serbs during the reign of the Ottoman Empire over the country, finally bringing about a reconciliation between our two nations. This marks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the Balkans."
 tur.95.a: "这一天应该载入史册！"
 tur.96.t: "塞尔维亚人拒绝了我们的请求"
 tur.96.d: "Sadly, the Serbs decided that they would rather live in the past than in the future. Citing the crimes committed by the Ottoman Empire during its reign over Serbia as the reason, they declined our request to join the Belgrade Pact. It appears that the people of the Balkans just can't get over their differences that easily."
 tur.96.a: "无论如何，没有他们我们会更好。"
 tur.97.t: "The Mareşal Publishes an Autobiography"
 tur.97.d: "After the nation had stabilised, Fevzi Pasha began turning his attention towards literature. His goal was to create an autobiography of himself, one which would inspire the reader and explain his motives and measures to him. A few weeks ago, Fevzi finally finished his work. Thousands of copies were printed almost immediately thereafter, and then sent to book stores all across the nation in a hurry. The first reviews by critics were almost unanimously positive, with the majority of them saying that the autobiography is truly a work of quality, shows the Mareşal in a completely new light, and is something everyone who wants to truly understand our leader should have read at least once.\n\nIn most stores, the books were sold out within the first few days, with many Turkish families being eager to find out more about their leader. Now, the streets are filled with people enjoying Fevzi's work and story. Cafes are full of men reading it, neighbourhood meetings are getting dominated by discussions about it, and there are even some members of the OHF advocating the incorporation of the biography into the curriculum, arguing that every child should know about the story of the Mareşal and the struggles he had to endure. By now, Fevzi's autobiography has become a well-known piece of literature in the entire country, and it's probably going to be regarded as one of the most important Turkish books of the 20th century in the future."
 tur.97.a: "A fine piece of literature."
 tur.98.t: "Fevzi's Tank Exercises"
 tur.98.d: "For the Mareşal, it has always been of utmost importance that the Turkish nation and her people embrace the modernity he advocates. However, unlike others who want to prioritise the modernisation of the industry and the government, the Mareşal thinks that the military should be our focus. This, of course, means the amplified use of tanks in the armed forces - a step many of our officers, especially the older ones, dread, since it also indicates that they'll have to study entirely new tactics and strategies.\n\nUnlike other high-ranking officers, the Mareşal didn't let himself get intimidated by this fact. A few days ago, he decided to lead the charge and organise a tremendous tank exercise. By doing so, he wanted to learn about the new ways of warfare and be a good example for the other officers. This week, it was finally time for the drill to begin. During the exercise, the Field Marshal ordered the tank battalion under his command to drive in various formations, and from time to time ordered his tanks to take strategic positions and open fire on specific targets - hills, trees, and even some abandoned buildings.\n\nOverall, the exercise turned out to be quite a success. The soldiers involved are now familiar with basic strategies of armoured warfare, and many officers are more than eager to conduct similar exercises in order to enhance their own abilities as tank commanders. As for the Mareşal himself, he appears to have grown quite fond of tank warfare, has already picked up a few basic tactics, and has been working tirelessly on working out new strategies and formations. Now all that remains to be seen is if he can use them as efficiently on the real battlefield as he did during the exercise."
 tur.98.a: "The modern battle field awaits!"
 tur.99.t: "The Position of Prime Minister"
 tur.99.d: "When [TUR.GetLeader] assumed the office of president, he effectively unified two positions that are strictly separated in many countries. Seeing as he now holds most of the power in our government and enjoys almost unlimited freedoms, some members of the party have begun to question if it wouldn't be a better idea to split the offices of prime minister and president in order to guarantee the separation of powers.\n\nDoing so would reduce [TUR.GetLeader] to a figurehead with mostly representative tasks. These would include state visits to other countries, speeches for our people and the management of the government's welfare programmes. Meanwhile, the prime minister would become the embodiment of the legislature and set our main political goals. The influence he would have on our nation's politics should not be underestimated, which is why we should choose someone close to Kemal for this office, lest our nation deviate from the course the Gazi has set in his will. Already, parliament has decided on a man that would be perfect for the job: Celal Bayar, an advocate of a democratic system and close associate of Mustafa Kemal.\n\nAlthough Bayar would surely do a great job and be more than grateful to get an opportunity to carry the flame that the Gazi has ignited, we could also just stick with [TUR.GetLeader] and let him keep both positions. While this would also let him keep the powers that a minority of the party deems a threat to democracy, [TUR.GetLeader] has proven his capabilities and his good intentions through and through. Stripping away a part of his powers could severly hurt our nation if they land in the hands of a man only half as competent as him. Now, parliament will have to decide if wants to entirely entrust the future of our nation to [TUR.GetLeader], or if it wants to separate his powers and give Celal a chance to prove his worth."
 tur.99.a: "The positions of president and prime minister should be merged!"
 tur.99.b: "They should be separated! Celal will surely do a great job."
 tur.100.t: "Ankara, the New Home of the Turkish People"
 tur.100.d: "Kostantiniyye has been our nation's capital since it has been conquered by Sultan Mehmed II in 1453. Sadly, in the past few years Kostantiniyye has lost much of the glory and glamour that once earned it the name 'city of the world's desire'. It has become a place of political intrigue and has been corrupted by the schemes of those hungry for power. While this had also been a problem in past centuries, with numerous sultans dying prematurely or being forced to abdicate the throne, the situation developed into a nightmare as the end of the Empire drew closer. The general political instability in the capital, which had been amplified by the outbreak of the Desert War, has caused numerous assassination attempts, the formation of various secret organisations and a general mistrust and dissent in the population.\n\nA few weeks back, [TUR.GetLeader] and his government have decided that this polluted and corrupted city should no longer be considered the home of the Turkish people. Instead, they think the capital of the Turkish state should lie in the hills of Anatolia, in the city of Ankara. Its central position makes the city both of strategical and of geopolitical importance, and ensures that our citizens living on our eastern border no longer feel like they're being ruled from a capital that lies far away on the other side of the world. While some have pointed out that Ankara is a relatively poor city and should thus not represent the entire nation of Turkey, [TUR.GetLeader] insists on his decision, arguing that relocating our capital into the area will foster the economic growth of the city. Furthermore, he has also planned the expansion of the Ankara's infrastructure in order to make it more appealing to the outside world."
 tur.100.a: "Good riddance, Kostantiniyye!"
 tur.101.t: "新土耳其国歌？"
 tur.101.d: "To further bolster Turkish nationalism and to break with the Ottoman traditions even more, it has been decided that our nation needs a new national anthem. This anthem is supposed to represent everything the Turkish people stand for, and should be something we can sing with pride in front of the entire world. The search for a fitting song has been nailed down to two main candidates: Ceddin Deden and Kafkasya Marşı.\n\nCeddin Deden or Your Ancestor Is Your Grandfather is a song with relatively short text and a memorable melody, making it easy to learn even for children still in elementary school. It emphasises the heroic nature of the Turkish people and stresses the greatness of our ancestors that have conquered the lands we now call our home. The overall very nationalistic lyrics of Ceddin Deden show our people that they can be proud of being born Turkish, making it the perfect song to represent our nation.\n\nMeanwhile, Kafkasya Marşı or March of Caucasia focuses more on our brave soldiers. It tells the tale of our victories high up in the mountains of the Caucasus, where our men showed their courage and forced the enemy to retreat. While Kafkasya Marşı is overall more militaristic than Ceddin Deden, it more or less has the same message: the Turkish people are of heroic nature and should be proud of who they are."
 tur.101.a: "先辈的荣耀(Ceddin Deden)！"
 tur.101.b: "高加索进行曲(Kafkasya Marşı)！"
 tur.102.t: "The Hard-Working Men of Turkey"
 tur.102.d: "With [TUR.GetLeader] now leading our nation, he has decided that it is about time to visit the diligent and hard-working men of Turkey, many of whom live under relatively poor conditions. Right after taking office, he embarked on a journey through Anatolia, visiting many villages and speaking with the locals in order to get an idea of the situation at hands in the rural areas, and to ensure that the working population knows they're not alone in their struggles. What he saw shocked him deeply. Many of the pure souls living scattered throughout Anatolia have to work all day long, only to receive nothing but breadline wages. They're forced to live in relative poverty while people living in the cities enjoy a prosperous lifestyle. After his tour was over, [TUR.GetLeader] was more convinced than ever that something needed to be done.\n\nToday, he gave a speech in front of the new government palace in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. In it, he applauded the Turkish workers, thanking them for their services and assuring that he will do everything in his power to improve their living situation. Furthermore, he emphasised the necessity of a classless society, one in which people can live in equality and prosperity, without being hindered in their development by their social status. Throughout the country, the people believe that their cries have finally been heard. They hope that [TUR.GetLeader]'s intentions are as pure as his fine words made them out to be, and are slowly but surely regaining their trust in the government. Finally, they are beginning to see a light in the darkness that has become their lives."

 tur.103.d: "昨天早上，雷杰普·佩克尔与谢夫凯特·叙雷亚·艾德迈尔乘飞机前往巴黎，想要见识下公社的生活究竟有多么美好。在他们抵达机场并办理了一些手续后，他们开始游览这座城市，参观其中的出名景点。他们在著名的埃菲尔铁塔下了车，还爬到二楼，一览整座城市。佩克尔与艾德迈尔将观景描述为一种非凡的体验，城市本身也是非常美丽。接着他们在巴黎圣母院待了一段时间，又匆匆领略了协和广场和凯旋门，在这之后，[FRA.GetLeader]邀请他们参加官方国宴，享用传统的法国菜肴，如法式锅菜、油封鸡和里昂沙拉，看着菜肴摆上桌，两位嘉宾都很高兴。\n\n晚宴过后，艾德迈尔与佩克尔利用剩余时间参观了公社的议会，即劳工总议会。两人在那里收到了法国政界人士的祝贺，他们先是赞美土耳其人民目前取得的成就，接着就如何进一步改善土耳其国家提出了不少很好的建议。经过这番有趣的交谈后，佩克尔在议会前发表了简短的讲话，赞扬了在座政治家所创造的乌托邦，并祝愿他们和他们的国家享有和平与繁荣。在雷鸣般的掌声中，演讲结束了，这一天也快要结束了，佩克尔与艾德迈尔得赶着乘飞机返回[TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]。他们向法国人致意，作最后的告别，然后很快回到了土耳其。回来以后，两人陷入沉思，到底需要多少努力才能让土耳其成为像法兰西公社一样闪耀的宝石。"

 tur.104.d: "Reşat Çiğiltepe was a famous and renowned officer of the Ottoman army and even earned the respect of Mustafa Kemal himself for his victories during the Weltkrieg. He had always been a loyal defender of Turkey and her people, and stayed true to Kemal and his cause even after the Gazi's untimely death. Sadly, his loyalty was rewarded with a bullet to the chest, delivered by the men of General Fahrettin Pasha, who tried to stage a coup right after Kemal had died. Çiğiltepe, who was present in the capital at the time, was one of the first officers to organise the resistance, and tried to free the Sublime Porte from Fahrettin and his followers. Even though he was outnumbered and outgunned, he fought bravely until the end, side by side with his fellow soldiers. This gave Ismet enough time to muster an army that could defeat the defectors, and thus essentially saved [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nTo ensure that this sacrifice will never be forgotten, [ROOT.GetLeader] has ordered the construction of a memorial dedicated to Reşat Çiğiltepe and his brave soldiers. Today, it was finally time for the memorial to be inaugurated. After a patriotic and emotional speech about the heroism that Çiğiltepe proved that day, [ROOT.GetLeader] and the crowd present at the ceremony held a minute of silence to commemorate the sacrifice of these brave souls. They will forever be an example for the Turkish people, and showed our soldiers what true bravery looks like."

 tur.105.d: "Heeding Iskenderun's call for reunification with their Turkish brethren, the Syrian government has chosen not to stand against the will of its citizens. In an official meeting between representatives from both of our governments, it was decided that the province should once again be returned to our hands. By doing so, the Syrians hope to better their relations with our new state whilst also reducing the tensions along the border. Naturally, news of this development was well received by our population, and especially in Iskenderun, parades celebrating the reunification of the Turkish people are still being held. This enthusiasm also extends to our politicians, who are more than content with the fact that diplomacy has proven to be a more effective tool than warfare. Once again, it has been shown that the pen is indeed mightier than the sword."
 tur.105.a: "Reunited at last!"
 tur.106.t: "An Official Opponent"
 tur.106.d: "The republic has been proclaimed and democracy has been established! This development has largely restored the people's trust in the government, and even after weeks, the general feeling of enthusiasm can still be sensed in Turkish cities.\n\nHowever, in the eyes of [TUR.GetLeader], our new republic has been a democracy just in name ever since its proclamation. The reason for this is rather simple: the lack of an official opponent in the form of an opposition party, since there will always be only one leading party without it - [TUR.GetLeader]'s party. To remedy this issue and to end the de facto one-party rule, the creation of new political parties has been incentivised by our government. On the direct request of [TUR.GetLeader], the new Free Republican Party, consisting mainly of liberals under the leadership of Ahmet Muhtar Paşa, has been established and will from now on participate in Turkish elections. Furthermore, it will serve as the voice of those sceptical of the current government and will thus ensure that all of our citizens will be heard by our current leaders."

The Kurds, once believed to be a backwards people with no real hope of ever gaining independence, have managed to hold their own against our forces. By now, they have fortified their positions, and we can no longer hope to achieve a major breakthrough. We have lost our momentum, and have no choice but to concede our defeat.\n\nThis day marks the end of approximately 450 years of Turkish rule over the majority of Kurdistan, and has shown the entirety of the world how far we've truly fallen. With Kurdistan now officially having seceded, we have lost not just our last non-Turkish territories, but also the last remaining bits of prestige we were still holding on to. This has been a hard blow for our politicians and our military, both having failed to suppress the Kurdish revolt in time, but also for our people, whose pride and self-consciousness have taken a major hit. It will take some time for the Turkish identity to recover from this disaster..."

 tur.110.d: "今天，土耳其共和国在[TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]设立中国大使馆，正式承认中国国民党政府，开始建立亲切友好的双边关系。中国大使何凤山与孙中山先生之子孙科一道同[TUR.GetLeader]进行了友好的茶话会，三人讨论了他们对中国人民和土耳其人民悠久历史的认识和理解。\n中国的国民革命与凯末尔运动类似，是一场革命运动，力图终结盘踞中国的帝国主义，同时也在中国国民党的指导下孕育民主。这场运动充斥着中华民族主义，旨在使中国国家现代化。国民党创始人孙中山的“三民主义原则”与凯末尔的“六支箭”原则几乎相同。从本质上讲，土耳其人民党和国民党都自认为是青年共和运动，决心将现代性带入第三世界。此外，穆斯塔法·凯末尔·帕夏本人也受到国民党内的中国进步民族主义者的钦佩。中国方面已发表约745篇文章，详细介绍了凯末尔在奥斯曼帝国时期担任首相的成就，以及在奥斯曼帝国崩溃的混乱中，凯末尔的政治灵活性如何在分权的联邦派多年控制后引导国家走向稳定和现代化。国民党人认为凯末尔对西方的抵抗与他们对西方和日本帝国主义的不懈斗争相似。有些人可能还会把凯末尔视为土耳其的孙中山或把孙中山视为中国的凯末尔。"

 tur.111.t: "骨干派领导人"
 tur.111.d: "The Kadroist branch of the THF is probably best described as a group of intellectuals whose ideology may seem rather contradictionary on first glance, considering that it borrows heavily from both right and left-wing thought from all around Europe. Centered around and inspired by the newspaper Kadro, they've been advocating reforms since the beginning of the thirties, yet during the times of the Ottoman Empire, their demands went unheeded. Believing in a classless society, taking up Marxist ideas and endorsing the thought of a state-controlled economy, many regarded them as too extreme, and they remained relatively uninfluential outside the ranks of the Kemalists. However, now that the Empire has fallen and the Turkish Republic has been proclaimed, the age of reform seems nigh, and the Kadroist movement is slowly gaining some traction.\n\nWith the wind of change blowing in the new Turkish state, some Kadroist politicians seem to believe that it is about time for some change in their leadership as well. Until now, they have been led by Recep Peker, an influential and charismatic figure within the party open to the ideas of the Kadroist magazine. Although Peker's support has thus far resulted in at least some of these ideas being incorporated into the wider Kemalist thought, some feel as though he merely serves as a middle-man, and have now voiced their wish to be led by the true makers of the Kadroist view, the original authors of the magazine. Of these, Yakup Kadri, a famous journalist, has been nominated as the potential new face of the Kadroist political movement, and a vote has been held within the party branch, aimed at determining whether this proposed change would be beneficial to the movement as a whole. Now that the votes have been counted, it seems that the Kadroist politicians have chosen..."

 tur.112.t: "Merhaba, Mr. Testicle!"
 tur.112.d: "Though objectively a step towards a modern state and society, not all have embraced the recently passed Surname Law as a sign of progress. Indeed, a vocal minority opposed to the reform has grown louder these past few days. Composed mainly of the Traditionalists, who are naturally against any notion put forward by our government, and ethnic minorities such as Armenians and Greeks, who claim that this law is nothing 'but a veiled Turkification attempt' aimed at eradicating their traditions and culture, this group has organised protests against the Surname Law but has thus far failed to gather public support for their cause.\n\nMore peculiar, however, is the choice of some individuals to use the new law as an opportunity for nothing more than a tasteless joke. In what some party officials have described as 'an unacceptable boycott of our legislature', dozens of citizens have elected not to bring honour to their families but to turn themselves into a laughingstock by abusing the rather loose legal boundaries set by the law to change their surname into a grotesque obscenity. The most inapproriate choices, which raised some eyebrows but had to be waved through, included Çıplak (naked), Kaltak (whore), and Tasak (testicle).\n\nThough most of these jokesters probably didn't think too much about it, they've made a decision that will affect not only their own lives but also that of their families for generations to come, and since several figures in the party are unwilling to accept these insults to our culture, it has now been proposed to tighten the law and to retroactively outlaw any surname choices that may be seen as offensive or otherwise obscene."

 tur.113.t: "Abolition of the Caliphate"
 tur.113.d: "For over four hundred years, the Ottoman Sultan was also the Caliph of Islam, the supreme religious leader for many Muslims around the world. The sacred artefacts of the Prophet were kept under his protection in our country. All this was until today.\nAfter the final defeat of the Empire in the war against the Arabs, the Sultan and the Caliph was no longer respected by the faithful. After the proclamation of the Republic, Ismet decided to maintain the Caliphate despite Kemal's plans. Today we rectify this injustice to the plans of the great reformer.\nToday we have passed the last laws abolishing the Caliphate in our country forever and depriving the descendants of Osman of this title. The sacred artefacts have been transferred to the main museum in [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where they will remain under the protection of the state to prevent any other usurper from appearing."
 tur.113.a: "Long live the Republic, secular and independent!"
 tur.114.t: "Acts of Resistance"
 tur.114.d: "With the Kurdish population growing increasingly unruly, it should not come as much of a surprise that attacks on the local infrastructure in our Kurdish territories have tremendously grown in number over the past few weeks. Roads and railways have been damaged by explosives and rockfall or have been otherwise blockaded, telegraph lines have been cut, and, following a number of ambushes on our patrols, the local gendarmerie now mostly refrains from travelling too far into the Kurdish hinterland. Since much of the local population furthermore refuses to cooperate with our soldiers, many even aiding the rebels through supplies, information, and shelter, and since reinforcements from the capital have a hard time reaching our brave men in Erzurum and beyond, control over the region has been limited severely, as has our ability to counteract the resistance.\n\nOf course, the damage done by the insurgents can be rectified. This, however, will take both time and effort, and the Kurds will do everything in their power to halt these endeavours, especially since the gendarmerie is currently too understaffed to safeguard more than the most important towns and railway hubs in the region."
 tur.114.a: "We have to act!"
 tur.115.t: "A Fateful Night in Halilçavuş"
 tur.115.d: "Halilçavuş, a relatively quiet small village which lies a few dozen kilometres to the southeast of Erzurum, has become the scene of a major tragedy a couple of days ago, when in the midst of the night, its population was shaken awake by the thunderous stampede of nigh fifty horses advancing towards the village. Whilst most citizens were still perplexed and unsure what was happening, the raiders set a number of outlying buildings ablaze and ransacked and plundered others - with no regards for their residents. However, the brave people of Halilçavuş, unwilling to let the onslaught advance further, organised a makeshift defence force and managed to repel the attack, sending the intruders, who were most likely caught off guard by the villagers' courage, back into the mountains from whence they came. Before the gendarmerie got word of the incident and could send a force to aid Halilçavuş in its defence, the fighting was long over, and when the sun rose in the east, two dozen laid dead, even more were wounded, and the village itself was greatly damaged.\n\nThe attack was, without a doubt, the making of Kurdish tribal leaders wanting to show our government their strength, though the gendarmerie has thus far been unable to track down the perpetrators, who are now hiding in the Kurdish hinterland. This is not the first time the Kurds have raided a town or village in the east. However, in the past these attacks were mainly directed against Christians - not Turks. As such, news of this event has been met with public outrage and cries for our government to act, and although [TUR.GetLeader] has already given a speech honouring the heroic villagers of Halilçavuş and has promised that the government shall allocate the funds necessary to rebuild what has been destroyed, much more will have to be done if we wish to prevent this from becoming a reoccurring event."
 tur.115.a: "This will not go without consequences!"
 tur.116.t: "Three Shots in the Morning"
 tur.116.d: "This morning, after one of our leading gendarmerie officers in the Kurdish region had just left the operational headquarters in Erzurum to inspect a new load of arms that had arrived from the capital the day before, he was ambushed by a small group of rebels, who had pretended to be just another bunch of civilians roaming the streets of the city. Before anyone had time to react, they pulled out their weapons, and delivered three fatal bullets to the officer's chest - he laid dead in the blink of an eye. The vile insurgents, who refused to surrender even in the face of overwhelming odds, were killed in the ensuing shoot-out, whilst a number of our soldiers were wounded.\n\nA relatively high-ranking officer murdered in broad daylight - it is only natural that news of this incident reached the capital in no time. The government, angered and frustrated, has already decreed the deployment of additional soldiers in the Kurdish provinces, and has allocated additional funds to the suppression of the rebel forces, citing that 'this cold-blooded atrocity has once again shown the nation that the only language these agitators understand is the use of force'."
 tur.116.a: "Now they've officially carried it too far..."
 tur.117.t: "The Lion of the Desert against the Army"
 tur.117.d: "As time passes, it becomes increasingly clear the public's acceptance of the countercoup is far from welcome. Many officers and ordinary soldiers blame the Liberals for losing the Desert War, believing the current government is no better, especially as it includes the same people. Similarly, many have not accepted the Sultan's abdication, and rumours are circulating among the people that this is how Fahrettin is going to establish an \"eternal regency\" under his own dictatorship.\nWe are also worried about the opposition, now led by Fevzi Pasha. After the countercoup, Ismet Pasha could no longer claim to be the leader of the OHF after Kemal's death, as he discredited himself by allowing Fahrettin to seize power, and the ambitious Fevzi became the leader of the clique. Unfortunately, we failed to catch him immediately; he is now on the run, which makes our position even more difficult, as we have no hope Pasha will sit idly by. So a sooner coup, or at least a failed attempt, seems inevitable, both for the inhabitants of the capital and for the leaders of the provisional government.\nAs long as there is no way for us to change the situation, we can only be prepared for the unavoidable denouement. Considering the fact the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] garrison is not a very loyal to us and there are many open and secret supporters of the OHF and Fevzi, it would be reasonable to call for units from the eastern border to the capital - most of the soldiers there come from the peoples of the empire who were grateful to us for the introduction of religious freedom and decentralisation. Of course, such actions could precipitate Fevzi rebellion, but there is nothing we can do about it - let he who is blessed by Allah win."

 tur.118.t: "Fevzi Pasha Failed Revolt"
 tur.118.d: "This morning Fevzi and a group of his supporters appeared at the barracks of the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] garrison, where Pasha gave a fervent speech calling for an end to the outrage by the new government, accusing Fahrettin of installing his own dictatorship through the \"puppet\" OSP. The garrison, most of whose ranks were associated with the OHF, quickly enough sided with the rioters and marched towards the government residence. On the way they were joined by a large crowd. The soldiers guarding the residence were too few to resist, so all the key OSP leaders were captured by Fevzi, except Fahrettin himself, who had managed to flee the town to the newly cantoned units called in from the east near the city.\nBy midday the situation was still difficult - although loyal OSP units had surrounded the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the rebels had no intention of surrendering. Fahrettin was unwilling to storm the city as he feared it would endanger the lives of other members of the government. Suddenly Prince Ömer Faruk Efendi, who had managed to get out of the palace unnoticed, arrived at his headquarters. Many foretold this brave man's future as the new sultan when the provisional government will be ready to summon the rightful ruler to the throne. As he approached Fahrettin, he declared his support for the OSP's policies and even his willingness to personally participate in the storming of the capital. He also showed the Sancak-ı Şerif - or Sacred Banner, a priceless relic from Allah's time, kept in the palace and only brought out during battles. The last time this happened was over 100 years ago during the last rebellion of the Janissary Corps. Although the ancient ceremonial was flagrantly flouted, Ömer proposed the use of the banner - the first time the future Sultan had marched to siege his capital in this way.\nOn hearing of Ömer's joining the Fahrettin, Fevzi's ardour diminished. The assault began under the cover of night, when most of the common supporters of the OHF had dispersed - and ended successfully. The government members were released and the leader of the uprising himself was taken into prison."

The garrison, most of whose ranks were associated with the OHF, quickly enough sided with the rioters and marched towards the government residence. On the way they were joined by a large crowd. The soldiers guarding the residence were too few to resist, so all the key OSP leaders were captured by Fevzi, except Fahrettin himself, who managed to escape from the city. However, since there were no troops ready to support him, the Defender of Medina realized his situation and surrendered to the authorities.\nUnexpectedly, Fevzi did not declare himself the leader of the country, but reinstated the previous sultan, Ahmed, who had been deposed not more than a month before, to the throne, and became Grand Vizier under him. Naturally, the sultan had no choice but to submit. Not long after the coup had concluded, he gave a speech, which was broadcasted to the whole nation over the radio. In it, he informed the people of the change in politics and assured them that from now on, their voices would be heard, and that under his lead, our nation would return to its former glory."

In the following years, Refet joined the Committee of Union and Progress, served in the Ottoman Gendarmerie, and fought in the Italo-Turkish War and the Balkan Wars.

When Kemal claimed chairmanship of the former CUP in 1925, he was among the first to leave the party, since the Gazi's radically secularist notions directly contradicted with Refet's deep-rooted respect for the Sultan and the Caliphate. Staying mostly out of politics thereafter, the Paşa continued his service in the military, and, as such, took part in the defence of the Empire during the Desert War. His efforts proved futile, however, and with the Empire in shambles, Refet felt the need to act. With the support of a number of anti-OHF figures, he launched a coup against the OHF government, and has now established himself as the leader of an interim government, aiming to mend the scars of the weakened Empire."

 TUR_omer_fahrettin_turkkan_leader_desc: "The Lion of the Desert, the Defender of Medina: the renowned Ömer Fahrettin Paşa. Born in 1868 in Rusçuk, Bulgaria, his family was forced to flee to the Empire's capital in the wake of the Russo-Turkish War. His career in the military started at the Mekteb-i Harbiye-i Şahane, an Ottoman military school, from which he graduated top of his class. During his time there, he also developed a passion for photography and started learning French, before eventually graduating from the Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi, the Ottoman Military College, with the rank of staff captain in 1891. He was first deployed in Armenia, where he fought against the fidayi irregulars, and also served in the Italo-Turkish War and the Balkan Wars, though he did not see much action during these conflicts.\n\nThe Paşa would later achieve his first major success during the Weltkrieg, where he was stationed in Medina from 1916 onwards, commanding the defence of the city and the nearby Hejaz Railway against the Arab forces. Despite being cut off and surrounded for months, he refused to surrender the sacred city to the approaching savages and continued to hold the line until reinforcements arrived, earning him the respect and gratitude of the Ottoman people.\n\nThough he mostly refrained from interfering in the Empire's political scene, Fahrettin Paşa never thought much of the Kemalist movement, and his belief in the traditional virtues of Islam naturally led him to disdain Kemal's views. Fearing that the OHF usurpers would exploit the chaos following the Empire's defeat in the Desert War and lead the Ottoman people into their certain doom, he took his chances upon hearing of Kemal's death, rallied his allies, and staged a coup, placing himself at the top of a provisional government. Now, he seeks to undo the damage inflicted by Kemalist rule over the nation and to prepare the Empire for the return of its Sultan."
