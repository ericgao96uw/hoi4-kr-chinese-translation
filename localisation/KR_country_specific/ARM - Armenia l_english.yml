 ARM_armenian_broadcast_desc: "还有什么能比一个国家广播电台更能通知、逗乐、影响我们的民众呢？民众将因为一个亚美尼亚的广播电台对收音机和电力更感兴趣，而我们也能更好地控制他们所能收到的有关政治事件及其发展的确切信息。"

 ARM_mountain_corp_desc: "我们国家大部分是群山环绕的高地。固然，这带来了一些不利，但也极大地提高了我们的防御能力。我们应该训练士兵们，利用好这片难以通过的地形对付敌人，而让邻居在贸然踏入我们的领土之前好好掂量掂量。"
 ARM_heal_our_men: "伤兵医院"
 ARM_heal_our_men_desc: "在亚美尼亚人力比什么资源都更重要。对我们来说，一个士兵比得上德国人的十几个营。我们不能置伤员生死于不顾。我们必须要看护伤者，等他们痊愈后能再度拿起武器，保家卫国。为了救人，我们应该先扩建医院，再买更好的医疗物资。"

 ARM_airforce: "亚美尼亚空军"
 ARM_airforce_desc: "在海洋和陆地上逞凶斗狠可不能决定现代战争的胜负，制空才是决胜之道。一支现代高效的空军可以骚扰敌军，切断补给甚至把敌人炸得弃甲投戈。但建设一支现代空军可代价不菲，而从零开始更是要投入额外的时间和精力。总之，我们越早制定我们的空军建设计划越好。"
 ARM_radar_station: "建造雷达站"
 ARM_radar_station_desc: "雷达是一项常常被人低估的发明。虽然雷达不直接参与战斗，但它可以为我们提供有价值的信息来决定战果。它可以在我们无法用一般方法观测到的地方发现敌机，还能协助我们评估当前的天气状况，将军们的头疼将缓解不少。"
 ARM_rebuild_the_erivan_airport: "开放耶烈万机场"
 ARM_rebuild_the_erivan_airport_desc: "新建立的亚美尼亚空军需要一个中心基地以维持运作。在首都埃里温开放新的机场可以说是一石二鸟：我们的空军可以把这里作为总部，以维持其运作；我们的政府可以向航空货运开放机场，以促进我们的进出口。"

 ARM_little_airship_specialisation_desc: "我们的工业能力和我们的国家一样弱小。既然负担不起重型轰炸机或者战斗机这样耗费巨量资源的机型，我们大概只能专注于小型飞机了。但是，我们不能仅凭大小评价飞机。因为如果使用得当，轻型战斗机和侦察机能像大型飞机一样发挥重要作用。"
 ARM_airplane_workshop: "建立空军"
 ARM_airplane_workshop_desc: "显然，光有一个机场是不够的。亚美尼亚空军也需要飞机，以便能够开展行动。建设专门生产和维修适合我国军队使用的飞机的车间和工厂，将保证我们的飞行员永远不会缺高质量的飞机。"
 ARM_fortress_without_sky: "保卫亚美尼亚天空"
 ARM_fortress_without_sky_desc: "到目前为止，我们的防御工作大多集中在陆战上，而且大多是在建造旨在对付步兵、火炮、坦克等的防御工事上。但是，我们也必须关注天空，保卫我们的城市免受空中轰炸，为此，固定防空炮必不可少。"
 ARM_aerial_reconnaissance: "天空之眼"
 ARM_aerial_reconnaissance_desc: "现代飞机的首要优势之一就是在安全距离上从事间谍活动。例如，军用侦察机可以在不进入地面敌军射程的情况下收集重要情报。孙子曾说过，知己知彼百战百胜，凭借天空之眼，我们将始终知道何时投入战斗。"

 ARM_War_of_Liberation_desc: "经历上百年的外国统治与压迫，亚美尼亚人民终于可以骄傲地说够了！奥斯曼帝国的衰落与沙漠战争的爆发重燃了亚美尼亚独立的希望，但要让自由与解放成为现实，我们必须起来战斗！为了我们的家人！为了我们的未来！为了亚美尼亚！"

 ARM_propaganda_campaign: "组织宣传运动"
 ARM_propaganda_campaign_desc: "部分民众依然对恩日杰和他的政府怀有相当怀疑的态度，担心他们只会服务于自身的利益而不是亚美尼亚人民。开展一次大规模宣传运动可以帮助我们缓解这些担忧，提高战争的支持率。"

 ARM_unite_the_fedayis_desc: "“费达伊”是对那些离开家园和亲人，从嗜血凶残的土耳其人手中保卫祖国的亚美尼亚人的统称。现在亚美尼亚是一个真正的国家了，我们应该把那些非正规武装整合到有组织的军队中，实现军事力量的现代化与职业化，保卫我们挚爱的家园。"
 ARM_integrate_the_militias: "整合民兵"
 ARM_integrate_the_militias_desc: "亚美尼亚陆军已经名义上成立了，我们可以将分散各地的民兵武装整合到组织更优、规模更大的指挥体系中。这将允许我们在战场上运用现代战术，极大提升我们在可能的入侵中坚持下来的机会。"
 ARM_professionalize_the_army: "职业军队"
 ARM_professionalize_the_army_desc: "任何现代陆军的核心理念就是职业化，没有纪律和适当的训练，我们的士兵就会像一群苍蝇般被轻松歼灭，让国家向入侵者敞开大门。让我们将军事操演的方法与现代标准接轨，建立一支让人民骄傲的陆军！"
 ARM_the_savior_of_armenia: "亚美尼亚的救世主"
 ARM_the_savior_of_armenia_desc: "在亚美尼亚最需要的时刻，一个人站了出来，在步步紧逼的敌人面前保卫了祖国，决心播下一颗土耳其人与俄罗斯人都扑不灭的火种！除了英雄般的恩日杰，谁又能称得上是我们国家的救世主呢？"

 ARM_create_local_fedayis_units_desc: "过去数十年来，费达伊，一种由亚美尼亚志愿者结成的非正式武装团体成功地从土耳其压迫者手中守护了我们的国家和人民。没有他们的保护，亚美尼亚人恐怕早就不存在了。正因如此，我们何必改变他们的运作方式呢？他们不是已经证明了自身的有效性吗？"
 ARM_use_guerilla_tactics: "运用游击战术"
 ARM_use_guerilla_tactics_desc: "在与实力明显强大的对手作战时，游击战恐怕是最高效的作战方式了，在敌人最意想不到的地方伏击他们，切断他们的补给线，我们能以极小的代价造成巨大的伤亡。这种战术肯定能让其他国家在入侵我们前三思而后行的！"
 ARM_call_for_people: "号召参战"
 ARM_call_for_people_desc: "在国家需要的时候保卫祖国是每个亚美尼亚人应尽的义务，战线上每多出一个人，战争形势与趋向就能扳回一分。只要我们团结起来为亚美尼亚独立的共同目标而战，就决不会被敌人击垮！"

 ARM_create_people_militia_desc: "许多人翘首以盼着[ARM.GetLeader]下达武装的命令，在赶往前线以前，他们需要的不过是武器罢了。我们应该把这些新入伍者整编为小的民兵团，彼此独立活动，对敌军行动展开迅速而果断的反击。"

 ARM_coordinate_with_teheran_desc: "在与奥斯曼的战争中我们绝非孤身一人，整个中东都渴望从地球上铲除这个堕落帝国，[PER.GetNameDefCap]也是他们中的一员。也许我们与[PER.GetAdjective]存在不少差异，为了战胜突厥野兽，团结起来是明智之举。"

 ARM_armenian_ideal_desc: "一个优秀的亚美尼亚人应该具有勤劳、勇敢、虔诚、顺从等特质，而其中最首要的是顺从。如果我们想要我们的人民拥有这些特质，我们必须大力推广它们。学校应该修改它们的课程，教会我们的孩子这些特质的价值；宣传这些理念的海报应该装饰着我们城市的街道。"
 ARM_first_christian_nation: "最早的基督教国家"
 ARM_first_christian_nation_desc: "宗教是氏族教运动的支柱之一。在我们的民族遭受外国统治的时候，我们的人民对亚美尼亚使徒教会的信任将他们团结了起来。亚美尼亚作为第一个正式接受基督教的国家，宗教一直是亚美尼亚文化中的重要部分。让我们向全世界展示什么是真正的基督徒！"
 ARM_personality_cult: "恩日杰个人崇拜"
 ARM_personality_cult_desc: "如果没有恩日杰，氏族教运动将不复存在。他曾带领着我们民族穿过黑暗，走向光明。亚美尼亚全国因他获得自由和解放。现在是我们正式确立他民族英雄地位的时候了。从今以后，所有人都将为亚美尼亚之鹰鼓掌！"
 ARM_expansionism: "亚美尼亚扩张主义"

 ARM_revenge_against_turks_desc: "我们与土耳其人之间的历史……至少可以说是很困难的。几个世纪以来，他们奴役我们的人民，压迫反对他们专制政权的任何形式的抵抗。虽然我们在很长一段时间内对此无能为力，但现在土耳其人刚刚遭受了沉重的打击，比以往任何时候都弱得多。我们复仇的时候到了……"
 ARM_recover_karabagh: "声索卡拉巴赫高地"
 ARM_recover_karabagh_desc: "卡拉巴赫地区与我国素有姻缘，但1919年的高加索会议将它从我们手中夺去了。那时我们无力抵抗这种专制的和平，更不得已臣服于最高朴特。但现在，我们已然从土耳其人手中夺回了自由，是时候夺回另一个属于我们的东西了。"

 ARM_superiority_eternity_desc: "亚美尼亚人为自己骄傲！他们全凭自己，创造了这个永恒的国度，这个时之沙带不走的国度！也许有人会妄想夺走我们的成就，但他们终将失败，明白亚美尼亚屹立于此！"

 ARM_military_government: "枪杆子里出政权"
 ARM_military_government_desc: "我们的政府理所当然地受到了军方的深远影响。虽然一些激进的共和派喜欢强调这带来的缺点，但它也好处多多。例如因为军方不可能政自己的变，我们几乎不怎么需要害怕颠覆政权。我们应该努力让更多的民众相信这个事实：军政府并不像乍看的那么糟糕。"
 ARM_mountainous_stronghold: "亚美尼亚堡垒化"
 ARM_mountainous_stronghold_desc: "我国国境上的山脉长久以来一直是亚美尼亚人抵御入侵的天然屏障，显然，只有他们是远远不够的。自然地形可没法击溃敌军，真要击溃敌军还得看人造防御工事。只有能抵挡敌军炮火和轰炸的堡垒才能给予亚美尼亚人民安全。"
 ARM_integrate_military_in_the_government: "政军一体"
 ARM_integrate_military_in_the_government_desc: "军事早已成为了政府中的一部分，再也没有什么理由让政治和军事继续分离运作了。是时候让他们合二为一了。当然，这不可避免地会让军队更轻松地影响国内政治，但这同时也让执政联盟中的达什纳克势力能够更得心应手地控制军队的影响力。"
 ARM_sponsor_military_research: "Increase Military Research Funds"
 ARM_sponsor_military_research_desc: "With the military growing ever more influential, voices within the government advocating an increased allocation of funds to our institutes for military research have grown louder as well.

 ARM_dashnak_support: "确保达什纳克的支持"
 ARM_dashnak_support_desc: "虽然大部分达什纳克党人都支持图存党，仍有少数人还抱有着建立一个“真正的”共和国的目标。我们应该让他们知晓我们的善意，并说服他们我们是唯一一股有能力也有决心为亚美尼亚之独立而奋斗的势力。"
 ARM_revolutionary_idea: "革命理念"
 ARM_revolutionary_idea_desc: "达什纳克党一直都不是一个完全赞成工团主义体系的政党，他们要求的是在经济领域温和的革命。现在他们在政府里已经获得了更高的地位，总算能完成他们一直惦记着的温和“革命”了。他们将会向工人证明：追求美好生活的过程中未必一定带有激烈的改革甚至革命什么的。"
 ARM_a_new_social_system: "新社会系统"
 ARM_a_new_social_system_desc: "达什纳克党人除了想要在经济领域进行温和的革命以外，他们还准备把手伸向国内的社会体系里去。平等和团结将成为亚美尼亚人日常生活中的主旋律，财富、私有资产的重要性将会下降——当然，还是在资本主义制度下。"
 ARM_protect_the_revolution: "保卫革命"

 ARM_collaborate_with_turkey: "与旧敌修好"
 ARM_collaborate_with_turkey_desc: "土耳其人在历史上一直是亚美尼亚人的“老熟人”了，由于历史上的种种过节国内多数人都对土耳其人没什么好的印象。但是如果我们的国家想要在当今这样的世界局势下生存下来，和我们南边的这个强邻保持一个相对友好的关系还是很有必要的——毕竟土耳其人的政府最近也经历了一次变革嘛，搞不好这意味着一个崭新，美好的开端呢……"
 ARM_armenian_nationalism: "发扬亚美尼亚民族主义"
 ARM_armenian_nationalism_desc: "我们的人民完全可以，也应该为他们身体中流淌着的亚美尼亚人的血脉而感到自豪。我们灿烂的历史，优美的语言，共同的民族认同深深的烙印在每一个亚美尼亚人的心里。我们应该强调亚美尼亚文化和历史的优越性，毕竟，一个遗忘了本族历史的民族还怎么将自己和其他民族区分开呢？"
 ARM_a_benevolent_people: "民意仁善"
 ARM_a_benevolent_people_desc: "善良而宽厚，自豪而谦逊，勇敢而勤劳——这些只不过是亚美尼亚普罗大众的一些基本特征。我们应该通过团结与和谐的生活向世人展示亚美尼亚人民的良善愿景与伟大品质。"
 ARM_promote_heroism: "发扬英雄主义"
 ARM_promote_heroism_desc: "如果不是独立战争中挺身而出的英雄们，我们如今可能还在对着卑鄙无耻的土耳其人卑躬屈膝。如果不是为了民主奋不顾身的英雄们，独夫恩日杰就会给国家与民族带来死亡与毁灭。我们的人民总是一次又一次地被往日的英雄拯救，现在，是时候鼓舞明日的英雄了！"
 ARM_arrest_criminals: "扫黑除恶"
 ARM_arrest_criminals_desc: "独立战争的突然爆发带来的社会动荡让执法成为了无稽之谈，那些宵小之辈因此得以逍遥法外，自以为高枕无忧，犯下一桩又一桩的罪行。犯罪狂潮正在高涨，我们必须重拳出击，必要时甚至可以借助军队的力量。"
 ARM_reform_the_military: "军事改革"
 ARM_reform_the_military_desc: "我们的军队之所以能赢得独立战争，不过是因为奥斯曼人在多条战线上各自为战。如果我们想只靠自己赢得战争，那么军事改革就迫在眉睫，首先就要从我们武装部队的领导权和最高指挥权开始。"
 ARM_end_the_state_of_emergency: "终结紧急状态"
 ARM_end_the_state_of_emergency_desc: "宣布紧急状态是为了让贝伊和他的追随者能够巩固新成立的亚美尼亚人民政府。在贝伊的正义统治不再受到任何威胁的当下，我们应该结束紧急状态，重新允许其他民主党派的加入。"
 ARM_call_for_democrats: "国家自由化"
 ARM_call_for_democrats_desc: "自由和民主是贝伊长久以来的目标。在紧急状态已经解除的今天，他终于可以为达成这一目标而努力，他认为，达成自由民主的第一步就是开放公立学校并吸引外国投资。"
 ARM_social_reforms: "发动社会改革"
 ARM_social_reforms_desc: "我国目前的社会制度只能够用千疮百孔来形容。在着手提升人民的生活水平之前，我们必须先进行大刀阔斧的改革。如确保国民宗教自由、降低医疗服务费用以及简化行政架构。"

 ARM_foreign_investments_desc: "我们需要稳健的外资流入以确保我们的经济发展蒸蒸日上。因此，拉姆卡瓦尔提议透过减税及增加出口产品类型以让我国产业变得更为有利可图及更具吸引力，并以此吸引外国企业家投资。"

 ARM_russian_concessions: "向俄罗斯让步"
 ARM_russian_concessions_desc: "正如我们所预料的那样，俄罗斯提供庇护的条件是要求了工业产值形式的保护费。尽管这毫无疑问多少会对我国工业造成些损伤，但如此便能生活在免于恐惧的和平中，这一条件实在太过诱人。有俄罗斯棕熊罩着我们，再无敢对我们的土地打小算盘的外敌了！"

 ARM_specialised_army_2: "Werewolves of Armenia"
 ARM_specialised_army_2_desc: "Our efforts to train our soldiers for combat during nighttime have borne fruit.

It's a rather simple problem, but one that is nigh impossible for us to solve on our own, as the Armenian nation, young and in disarray, lacks the industrial capabilities to supply the men fighting for our freedom with much-needed equipment. As such, we have to turn to other nations for support - and the Russians might be our best bet. During the Weltkrieg, our people already fought side by side with Russian soldiers against the Turkish oppressors - so why shouldn't they aid us in our endeavours again?"

With the Georgians sitting idly in their mountains, and with the Ottoman army still in disarray following the recent cascade of revolts, it is time to make our move and to advance towards the sea!"

 arm.1.d: "数世纪以来，来自外国的侵略者们一直统治着亚美尼亚的人民。俄国人、波斯人和奥斯曼人都以为他们应该拥有我们的土地，相互之间爆发了无数冲突。尽管亚美尼亚地区总是能获得自治权，但占领者们对这片土地上的人民可不会有什么好脸色。土耳其人的所作所为更是罄竹难书，他们把我们视为二等公民，是要被“土耳其化”的人。正是这种想法直接导致了1894年到1896年间的哈米德大屠杀与世界大战期间的亚美尼亚大屠杀。他们的暴行没有让亚美尼亚人屈服，反而滋长了亚美尼亚人的民族情绪，增强了亚美尼亚人的抵抗精神。有如费达伊这样的组织保护亚美尼亚的村庄不受土耳其人与库尔德人的掠夺，争取自治，保持安全，而其他如达什纳克党这样的组织则高呼要求建立一个独立的亚美尼亚国家。\n\n自由的亚美尼亚之梦在1918年成为了现实。俄罗斯帝国崩溃后，亚美尼亚人趁混乱之机分离独立。然而就在大约一年之后，周遭的国家们在科斯坦丁尼耶召开了一场会议：奥斯曼、格鲁吉亚和阿塞拜疆瓜分亚美尼亚。这个协议对缺乏力量的亚美尼亚共和国打出了最后一击。\n\n但我们的人民并没有失去希望，他们继续等待着重获自由之日，一部分人撤退到了卡拉巴赫继续抵抗。在中东各地纷纷起义对抗最高朴特，土耳其人独自对抗阿拉伯联军的当下，这一天似乎终于到来了。今天，我们说：够了！全国的志愿起义者们正在组织民兵，解除土耳其驻军的武装。是时候向奥斯曼人证明，我们是不会被轻易击垮的！为了亚美尼亚！为了亚美尼亚！"

 arm.3.d: "听到亚美尼亚人民奋起反抗奥斯曼帝国统治的消息后，加列金·恩日杰旋即决定结束他在高卡拉巴赫的自我流放。恩日杰不仅是一名出色的战士，更是一位知名的将军。他作为俄罗斯方亚美尼亚营的一员参加了波斯的宪政革命，而当俄罗斯帝国崩溃后，他撤退到了高加索地区，和其他人一同创立了亚美尼亚国民军。\n\n他试图利用他新成立的准军事部队将土耳其人和阿塞拜疆人逐出高加索地区，以此加强亚美尼亚在的地位。但奥斯曼人随即进行了报复，并在1919年的年中粉碎了亚美尼亚人的抵抗。由于未能从土耳其人的手中保护亚美尼亚，恩日杰决定撤退，并在高卡拉巴赫山区重新组织起了部队。高卡拉巴赫过去属于亚美尼亚，但在高加索会议期间被划给了阿塞拜疆，而他则在这片群山中继续为了亚美尼亚的独立而战。恩日杰恐吓着此处的非亚美尼亚居民们，导致阿塞拜疆政府无法对此处进行有效的治理。而他多年间在高加索地区想方设法取得了巨大的影响力，这些影响力甚至足以使他能为卡拉巴赫以外的亚美尼亚抵抗运动提供物资，我们部队迄今为止取得的成就很大一部分要归功于恩日杰。\n\n如今恩日杰终于回到了亚美尼亚，他在几十年间的常规战争与游击战中积累的经验将带领我们的部队战胜野蛮的土耳其人。人民为他的到来欢呼雀跃，无不认为这是“主的祝福”。在他的指引下，没有什么可以阻挡我们的脚步！"

 arm.4.t: "与黎巴嫩的外交"
 arm.4.d: "尽管黎巴嫩的面积相对较小，但它却是中东地区最大的亚美尼亚人散居地之一。在亚美尼亚大屠杀时期，成千上万的亚美尼亚人为了躲避奥斯曼帝国军队逃离了安纳托利亚的东部和南部。由于无家可归，许多人来到了黎巴嫩，大部分人主要定居在黎巴嫩山的穆塔撒勒夫领，但也有小部分人定居在在周边城市，如贝鲁特和杰巴尔。大多数的当地人热情好客，让移民们能够迅速融入当地社会，而亚美尼亚文化同样也丰富了当地的生活。\n\n黎巴嫩刚刚才与叙利亚进行了一场血战，宣布了自己的独立，可以说，黎巴嫩人民不得已进行的斗争与我国过去不得不面对的斗争非常相似。他们也像我们一样被迫与一个更强大的敌人抗争，最终取得了胜利。如今战争胜利，黎巴嫩同样也经历着与我们一样的独立问题：政治孤立。为了解决这个问题，[LEB.GetLeader]接触了当局，表示希望在两个国家之间建立外交关系。考虑到两个国家联系在一起的文化纽带以及未来的合作可能带来的好处，当局接受了这一提议，并在首都建立了黎巴嫩大使馆，这不应该令人感到惊讶。我们只能希望，这一天标志着两国之间伟大友谊的开始。"

 arm.7.d: "奥斯曼帝国，这个几个世纪以来一直奴役和残害我国人民的国家已经不同以往。沙漠战争的失败改变了这个国家，他弃土失地，政治飘摇，土耳其人被迫去追寻新的路线。虽然我国很多人都对土耳其人恨之入骨，但这种不计后果的仇恨不再合理了。我们的邻居不再是过去那个欺凌我们的人了。为了两个国家的利益，我们应该尝试与土耳其人正式和解。希望他们能像我们一样明智而善解人意，并接受我们适度的提议。"

 arm.8.d: "Earlier this week, a proposal from our Armenian neighbours reached [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. In it, the Armenian leadership pledged for the signing of a treaty of friendship between our two nations, showing that they are willing to evolve beyond the age-old hostilities that have divided our people for centuries. Nevertheless, some parts of our government see this proposal as outrageous, arguing that Armenia should be considered a Turkish province and as such be reintegrated into our country. Furthermore, many politicians still remember the bloody war our two nations fought against one another vividly, and think that official reconciliation between [TUR.GetNameDef] and Armenia would be disrespectful towards the victims of said war. Still, there are also some saying that a treaty of friendship could help secure peace in the region, and would bring advantages for both sides. Although this may be true, if we were to accept this proposal, we would also have to defend Armenia against anyone trying to invade the country in the future - a risk that has to be calculated carefully."

 arm.9.d: "Great news! The Turks have accepted our treaty of reconciliation, citing that the hostilities between our two countries have thus far been disadvantageous to both of our nations. In the name of peace, they officially recognised Armenia as an independent state and the Armenian people as free from Turkish rule. Furthermore, the Turks promised to defend us against any threats that may arise in the future. A new era of Turkish-Armenian friendship has begun!"
 arm.9.a: "终于，两族安享太平！"
 arm.10.t: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap]拒绝！"
 arm.10.d: "Sadly, it appears that the Turks are not yet ready for such drastic changes as a treaty of friendship with our nation. Citing that Armenia has 'always been a Turkish province, and will soon be one again', the government of [TUR.GetNameDef] has refused to sign our proposal. Thus, the Turks have proven to be unable to evolve beyond their ultranationalist mindset, which could very well lead to another war between our two nations in the near future."

 arm.12.d: "The revolutionary coalition, consisting of the Hunchaks and the Communists, has won the first Armenian elections and thus paved the way for a true revolution and a better life for the Armenian people. However, now that power sits firmly in their hands, the Hunchaks and Communists have fully become aware of their vastly different opinions on many subjects, such as our economic and foreign policies. Still, the two parties stayed true to the revolutionary spirit and didn't let these differences drive a wedge between themselves. After some short debate, they managed to find a solution that could satisfy both of them: an Armenian Popular Assembly.\n\nThis assembly is to be held in Yerevan, where it shall decide which of the two factions should take the leading role in the revolutionary coalition and determine our nation's future politics. Representatives from all over Armenia have been invited and are currently pouring into our capital. While some of them are die-hard defenders of the Hunchak or Communist cause, many are still on the fence. This makes the outcome of the assembly rather uncertain and has encouraged political discussions and speculations in newspapers and cafes. It almost seems as if the entire population of Armenia is currently awaiting the first decisions of the assembly with bated breath. Soon, the revolutionaries will give their first speeches, the first major debates will be held, and the future of our nation will be decided."
 arm.12.a: "革命者集结！"
 arm.13.t: "人民大会：决定政治目标"
 arm.13.d: "The time has come! Today, the representatives of the revolutionary coalition shall come together and vote on what exactly the main political goal of the new government should be.\n\nThe more moderate Hunchaks argue that the backbone of Armenia, and every other country in the world, is the average worker. When he suffers, the nation suffers as well. Seeing how poorly our most hard-working citizens have been treated by the Ottoman administration and the first provisional Armenian governments, the Hunchaks deem it necessary to enshrine workers' rights in our constitution and thus improve the standard of living across our nation. After all, it is unacceptable for a modern and revolutionary nation to let its citizens work under the poorest conditions while receiving nothing but breadline wages.\n\nWhile the Communists agree with most of what the Hunchaks say, they want to go a step further and totally transform our country. According to them, capitalism has failed the Armenian people and should be heavily restricted. They advocate a more Marxist approach, one that can finally bring the Armenian citizens the equality and autonomy they have always strived for. Even though this may sound nice on paper, some Hunchak politicians have been openly questioning the effectiveness and necessity of such a radical approach, arguing that it would likely do more harm than good.\n\nBoth sides have spent the last few days vigorously defending their point of view, trying to persuade as many representatives as possible. Today, we shall see which of the two factions was more convincing."
 arm.13.a: "工人权利至高无上！"
 arm.13.b: "国家亟须彻底转型！"
 arm.14.t: "人民大会：决定经济目标"
 arm.14.d: "The next issue that the assembly should address is the question of our economic policy. Whilst the Hunchaks and Communists agree that our current economic system is not in a very good state and in need of some major changes, it is still open to debate what exactly these changes should look like.\n\nAs was to be expected, the Hunchaks are in favour of a more moderate solution. They argue that we can not only improve our economy, but also the standard of living across Armenia, if we manage to find the right balance between social and economic reforms. For example, affordable healthcare and a decent minimum wage could make the life of our citizens much easier, while progressive taxes and a redistribution of wealth and income could help achieve our goal of a classless society, in which the economy doesn't solely serve the upper class. Furthermore, these reforms would be rather easy to implement, and would only require a few new laws to be passed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Communists advocate a radical approach. In order to achieve true equality and a society in which egoism is an alien concept, they deem it necessary to collectivise and nationalise major companies and businesses. An economy controlled by the state could better meet the needs of the Armenian people and would ensure that wealth is spread equally amongst them, would however also strip entrepreneurs of their freedoms - a trade-off which the Communists are more than willing to take."

 arm.15.d: "The last point on the agenda of the assembly is the foreign policy of our nation. It is no coincidence that this issue was saved for last, as it is the subject on which the opinions of the Communists and the Hunchaks differ the most.\n\nThe Hunchaks think that it is necessary for Armenia to reorganise its armed forces into a revolutionary army, one that can defend our nation even against superior foes and will do whatever it takes to guarantee the survival of the Armenian state. To further emphasise the importance of the military for our freedom, the leader of the Hunchak party, Rouben Ter Minassian, gave a patriotic speech in front of the assembly, honouring our brave soldiers and highlighting the fact that Turks, Russians and Persians will soon seek to subjugate our nation once more - something we can only prevent by building an army worthy of Armenia and her people.\n\nHowever, the Communists argue that this goes too far. The creation of a revolutionary army would make our society militant and could be used by our neighbours to justify a preemptive strike against our nation. They think that we should just focus on our own affairs and try to keep a low profile. This could give us a chance to develop our nation without foreign intervention and to prosper and flourish peacefully and quietly, would however also put us in a rather vulnerable position."

 arm.16.d: "The First Armenian Popular Assembly has concluded, and the representatives are slowly starting their journey back home. After all the different issues had been voted on and the votes had been counted, a clear winner was determined: the Communists under Anastas Mikoyan. Their political goals and measures seem to have been well-received by the representatives and the people, as shown by the clear majority the party has managed to achieve. Shortly after this news had spread throughout the country, Mikoyan gave a speech on the radio. In it, he thanked the people for putting their trust in him and his party, and promised that his policies would bring Armenia the peace and prosperity it deserves.\n\nAlthough some expected the Hunchaks to be bitter about their loss, considering that they were the ones who brought the revolutionary ideas to Armenia in the first place and thus probably hoped to defend them in the future, the Hunchak politicians nevertheless seem relatively content with their new position in the coalition. Rouben Ter Minassian even congratulated Mikoyan on the victory of his faction, promising to support him in his endeavour to revolutionise the nation. Both parties appear to be as close as ever, and more than eager to bring about an Armenian revolution."

After all the different issues had been voted on and the votes had been counted, a clear winner was determined: the Hunchaks under Sarkis Rouben Ter Minassian. As it seems, the representatives, and thus the people, do not want radical changes, but rather strive for moderate reforms capable of improving their living situation. In an address he gave to the press this morning, Minassian gave himself relatively unsurprised, saying that he had not once doubted that the assembly would choose the Hunchak party to lead the nation. Still, he thanked the people for their support and promised to bring them equality and liberty.\n\nWith the moderates now setting the agenda, the more radical Communists seem to be a tad bit disappointed. Though they still think that the Hunchak reforms won't be enough to truly change the Armenian nation for the better, they refrained from openly questioning the decision of the assembly and promised the Hunchaks their continued support. With the Hunchak-led coalition now guiding our way, peace and prosperity have become imminent!"

 arm.21.t: "肃清合作者"
 arm.21.d: "When our rebellion began, some officials loyal to the Ottoman Empire fled Armenia, fearing prosecution and imprisonment if they were to stay. However, there were also members of the administration and the military that simply switched sides at the beginning of the war, saying that they would rather live in a free Armenian state than in one dominated by the Turks. These men have thus far been able to keep the positions they held under Ottoman rule, partly because it would not be an easy task to replace them. Nevertheless, it appears that Nzhdeh, who has by now become a hero of the Armenian people with substantial influence, is all but content with this situation.\n\nArguing that these officials cannot be trusted because of their affiliations with the vicious Ottoman Empire, he has now begun to take matters into his own hands. Today, he ordered the imprisonment of every \"collaborator\" still on Armenian soil. Whilst this has raised some suspicion, seeing as his definition of a collaborator is relatively loose and encompasses every official that has served under Ottoman rule, there has been no real opposition to these orders yet. Throughout the country, officials are getting escorted out of their workplaces by the military, officers are being discharged, and prisons are starting to fill up. Although Nzhdeh promised that he is doing all that just to secure Armenia's independence and security, this move also, coincidentally, created a power vacuum that he can now easily fill by appointing his own officials loyal to his cause."
 arm.21.a: "太残酷了，却是必要之恶。"
 arm.22.t: "合作者造反！"
 arm.22.d: "Although the arrest of the first wave of collaborators went off without a hitch, this was mainly because the military caught them off guard. By now, every Armenian knows of the prosecution of those that Nzhdeh branded enemies of the state. The remaining collaborators used the time they had to prepare themselves. Many of them went into hiding and have thus far been unlocatable. Since they can't just vanish off the face of the earth, it is suspected that they either fled the country, hoping to start a new life in their beloved Ottoman Empire, or have found refuge in the homes of Armenians willing to hide them from the eyes of the government. A few houses of friends and family members of the prosecuted have already been searched by the military, which has sparked some discontent, but has also resulted in the capture of some of the fugitives.\n\nNonetheless, a few collaborators have also been unwilling to leave their beloved home behind. Instead of hiding from the forces of the government, they chose to arm themselves. Our soldiers have by now reported almost a dozen instances of former officials opening fire on them. Luckily, none of our soldiers have been killed thus far, though some have been seriously injured. What makes these incidents alarming is the fact that almost all of the guns used by those resisting the arrest were weapons that could commonly be found in the Ottoman military. Either the collaborators stole them from the stockpiles we have captured from the Ottoman garrisons, or they still have contacts within the Empire, looking to fuel resistance against Nzhdeh's rule. Either way, we should try to disarm and imprison these traitors as quickly as possible."

 arm.23.t: "恩日杰宣布实施紧急状态"
 arm.23.d: "Arguing that our nation needs a strong and united government to survive the oncoming Ottoman onslaught, Nzhdeh and the leadership of the military have decided to proclaim the state of emergency, effectively centralising the power of the state around themselves. This gives them the freedom to rule without taking the opposition into account, to pursue whatever policies they please, and to take any measures they deem necessary to save the Armenian nation from its total annihilation. To pacify those who believe this is nothing but the disguised establishment of a dictatorship under military rule, Nzhdeh assured that he would lift the state of emergency once the war has been won and the dust has settled.\n\nWhile there are parts of the population that aren't satisfied with this promise, fearing that Nzhdeh and the military officers will grow too attached to the power they now possess, the majority of Armenia is quite content with this development. In Nzhdeh, the people see a man that knows what has to be done. They see someone who takes action instead of making promises he can never fulfil. In him, they see a figurehead that can unify the Armenian people - a trait that is urgently needed in these trying times. However, it remains to be seen how far the support of the people really goes, and if it will last after the war has been won and Armenia's independence is no longer directly threatened."

 arm.24.t: "恩日杰集权于一身"
 arm.24.d: "Since Nzhdeh declared the state of emergency, he has ruled over our nation together with the military leadership. However, it appears that his position in the government did not fully satisfy him. He wanted to centralise power around himself instead of sharing it, and has been pushing the military further into the background whilst trying to keep it loyal to him. Today, his endeavours have finally borne fruit, as he has officially been proclaimed leader of the Armenian state with the blessing of the military leadership. Whilst this new title doesn't change too much on paper, seeing as he has been pulling the strings in the government for quite a while now, it has caused some uncertainty in the populace.\n\nAfter Nzhdeh was proclaimed sole leader of Armenia, two camps formed within our population. On one side, there are Nzhdeh's followers. They claim that he is the only one capable of leading the Armenian people into their future and that he will bring them their long-desired victory over the Turks. For them, Nzhdeh's takeover is justified by his abilities and certainly nothing to be worried about.\n\nOn the other side, there are those sceptical of Nzhdeh and his regime. This camp mainly consists of the democrats and revolutionaries that have been denouncing Nzhdeh's authoritarian ways ever since he returned to Armenia. They see him as a threat to the freedom and liberty of the Armenian people, fearing that he won't end the state of emergency after the war has been won and will instead try to cement his power even further. To prevent this from happening, the democrats now want to search for new allies in the military, the administration, and the government. If they manage to convince enough officials of the threat that Nzhdeh poses, maybe they can stop him from consolidating his rule. But are they willing to risk attracting Nzhdeh's wrath?"

Until now, they have accepted this development, hoping that Nzhdeh would lead our nation to victory if they granted him the freedoms he desires. However, they are all but content with how the situation turned out. In their eyes, Nzhdeh has thus far not only used his powers for the good of the Armenian people, but also for his own personal gains - something that they deem unacceptable. In order to regain their influence in our nation's politics, the Dashnaks and the Ramgavar, the two main democratic parties of our country, have issued a joint request in which they demanded a place in the new government.\n\nWhilst Nzhdeh is in no way obliged to accept this request and could very well turn the democrats down, a few of his associates have pointed out that this may not be the best idea. After all, we are currently fighting a war against the Turks and should try to stay united at least until the conflict has been resolved, lest we collapse under the weight of our internal struggles. Furthermore, we don't have to give the democrats the most influential positions. Even a few smaller and non-important ones could satisfy them and guarantee that they stay loyal to Nzhdeh and his political course."

While they weep and mourn for their losses, the people of Armenia celebrate, for they can now once again live in freedom and liberty. However, this victory came at a cost. Many young Armenian men lost their lives, our economy has been utterly destroyed, and the Turkish part of our population is beginning to migrate to Anatolia, fearing suppression and persecution under their new Armenian overlords. Still, these losses shouldn't ruin the good mood of the people, at least for the moment. After all, our economy can be rebuilt, our soldiers knew that they gave their lives for something worth fighting for, and citizens loyal to the Turkish state would only corrupt our young nation.\n\nNonetheless, there have also been some rather unpleasant developments in our nation's politics. While celebrations are still taking place across the country, the different political parties of our nation have already begun falling out with each other. With our triumph over the Turks, there's no longer an immediate threat unifying our politicians, leading to them now once again fighting for their own interests. The democrats and revolutionaries have demanded free elections in order to replace Nzhdeh, arguing that he is no longer needed and his continued rule illegitimate. Meanwhile, Nzhdeh is trying to hold on to his power, saying that his victories have earned him the right to rule over the Armenian people. Seeing the differences between the two sides, it seems nigh impossible for them to reach an agreement. Our victory has turned our government into a powder keg waiting to explode."

While the exact content of their discussion remains unknown, the meeting lasted almost the entire night, and ended with Kajaznuni being convinced of Nzhdeh's good intentions and his capabilities as the leader of our nation. This change of mind animated Kajaznuni to better Nzhdeh's image within the ranks of his party, leading to the Dashnaks officially deciding to form a coalition with Nzhdeh's military junta. This coalition, which has the main political goal of safeguarding the independence of the Armenian state, has adequately been nicknamed the 'Survival Party'.\n\nWith the arguably most influential part of the democratic opposition now on his side, Nzhdeh has effectively cemented his power, with no other political faction being strong enough to challenge his rule. Naturally, the other democratic and revolutionary parties were all but content with the decision of the Dashnaks, and have branded them 'traitors to the democratic cause'. Still, the Dashnak part of the newly-formed coalition tried to get on their good side, promising progressive reforms in the economy and the Armenian social system, and arguing that an alliance with Nzhdeh was a necessary step to ensure Armenia's continued independence.\n\nFor the population, this news has been a blessing. Nzhdeh's experience and qualities as a leader and the democratic views of the Dashnaks seem to be the perfect ingredients for a prosperous Armenian state. The people trust the Survival Party, and expect nothing but peace, freedom, justice and security under their new leadership."

For him, the revolutionaries and democrats are weak for seeking to legitimise their rule through elections. Furthermore, some of these parties think that we should reconciliate with our neighbours and make friends of them - something that Nzhdeh views as another sign of their weakness. Because of his dissatisfaction with the current Armenian political scene, he has begun looking to other countries for inspiration. One that managed to catch his eye is the Russian behemoth to our north. Under the leadership of [RUS.GetLeader], Russia has taken a nationalist stance and managed to regain parts of its former glory.\n\nIn Nzhdeh's eyes, [RUS.GetLeader] is the leader the Russians have always dreamed of, and is someone whose example we should follow. In accordance with the Russian rhetoric, Armenia too should strive for unity through the power of nationalism. Nzhdeh's goals of ridding our nation of those that seek to destroy it and renewing the national and spiritual identity of our people have become the centre of his new ideology, which he named Tseghakronutyun or Tseghakronism, essentially translating to 'race and religion' - two concepts which Nzhdeh wants to turn into the pillars of our society. Already, people throughout Armenia are announcing their support for Nzhdeh and his new ideas, and are rallying behind the 'Eagle of Taron', the central icon of Tseghakronism."

Whilst his skills as a military leader may have contributed greatly to our recent victory, a large part of the population questions his capabilities as a leader during times of peace, and is now beginning to turn to the democratic parties. These parties have also not been inactive, and have been gathering support among the common folk, but also in the administration and the government. With virtually all of Armenia standing behind them, they were able to borderline force Nzhdeh to concede and to accept that elections should decide the future of our nation. Until then, he will keep his position, promising to keep order until the elections have come to a conclusion and a clear winner has been determined.\n\nThroughout the country, the preparations for the first Armenian elections in over twenty years have begun, and the people are excited to be able to choose their nation's government once again.

By now, most of the soldiers and officers that have served under Nzhdeh during our independence war have joined the new organisation, arguing that he has shown his qualities as a leader and that his ideas will bring Armenia the glory it has always desired. With the support of the military, Nzhdeh was able to cement his power without any opposition from the democratic parties, who have by now become too irrelevant to pose a threat to the new regime. Because of this, Nzhdeh has decided that they should not be outright dissolved, instead allowing them to continue to operate within the country. Still, with elections being frowned upon by the Tseghakronutyun, these parties have no real chance of ever coming to power.\n\nThese new political developments have, however, raised some uncertainty within the population. Although most of our citizens trust Nzhdeh, many view his new political course with scepticism. In particular, the minorities within our borders, such as the Azeris and the Turks, are now fearing for their rights and their lives. In an address Nzhdeh gave to the nation this morning, he once again promised to take any steps necessary to ensure the continued survival of the Armenian people and gave his word that he would rid our country of all those who stand in the way of his rule and his promised prosperity - a promise that has only fueled the fears of both the minorities and the opposition. It remains to be seen if the people will trust Nzhdeh to the end, or if their fear will lead them to divergent paths."

In order to convince the people of their political goals and agendas, both camps are now sending their most prominent politicians to radio stations and newspapers. With the help of these modern media outlets, they can appeal to the entire nation with ease.\n\nThe democratic coalition, consisting of the liberal Ramgavar and the social democratic Dashnaks, has a relatively wide base of supporters, containing entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and to a lesser extent also the common workers. Since the democrats are certain that the middle and upper classes rather dislike the thought of a revolution, they take the support of this part of the population for granted. Hence, they decided to focus their advertisement efforts on the lower classes of Armenian society, promising that the mild reforms advocated by the Dashnak party will bring the people prosperity, whilst also claiming that the promises of the revolutionaries will do more harm than good.\n\nMeanwhile, the revolutionary coalition, which is made up of the Hunchaks and the Communists, is also trying to convince the lower classes of their policies. They denounce the democrats as hypocrites, and argue that the liberals only seek to represent the interests of the capitalist upper class, not the hard-working men of Armenia. In a radio speech he held this morning, Anastas Mikoyan, the leader of the Communist party, emphasised the necessity of a total revolution, one which will cause a complete social upheaval and bring the workers of our country the rights and riches they desire.\n\nWith both factions fighting over the votes of one class, the workers and farmers of our country now essentially find themselves in the position of kingmaker.

This morning at around 8 a.m., the polling stations were opened and immediately thereafter stormed by a crowd of Armenian citizens eager to determine the future of their nation. Over the course of the day, the polling stations were almost constantly filled with people - the voter turnout was immense. Now that the day is nearing its end and everyone that wanted to participate in the vote has cast their ballot, the polling stations are beginning to close down. The first stations have already reported the results of the election in their area, but for now there seems to be a rather fragile balance between the revolutionaries and the democrats, with both sides having gained around half of the votes. Still, this will most likely be subject to change, as the largest polling stations have not yet finished the process of counting the ballots. The tension and excitement can be felt on both sides - but in the end, there can be only one winner."

For example, we cannot pursue the political agendas of both the Dashnaks and the Ramgavar, but rather have to choose whose policies we should put our focus on. To that end, it has been decided that an election committee consisting of politicians from the Dashnak and Ramgavar parties as well as some neutral statesmen shall be formed. This election committee will choose a candidate from either the Dashnak or Ramgavar party for the post of president, who shall then set the course of our nation and decide on the policies that will lead our people into their future.\n\nBoth parties have already determined their candidates. The Dashnaks have chosen Hovhannes Kajaznuni, a man known throughout the country for his service as prime minister of the First Armenian Republic during the closing stages of the Weltkrieg. He is an advocate of social reform and, in contrast to the Ramgavar, thinks that at least some revolutionary ideas should not necessarily be frowned upon by our government. The Ramgavar, on the other hand, have chosen Mihran Damadian, a former resistance fighter who believes in more liberal policies and the power of the free market. After both candidates gave a speech highlighting why they should be elected president, there were some debates and discussions among the members of the committee, but now it seems that they've managed to come to a conclusion.

Founded by the ancient Greeks centuries before the birth of Christ, the practically ancient city has switched hands several times in recent history between the Russians, Georgians, and Ottomans. As such, Batumi is nowadays home to a plethora of different cultures and religions, including an Armenian minority, with Georgians, however, forming a slight majority.\n\nThough the Ottoman garrison stationed in the city fought fiercely until the bitter end, they did not have time to destroy or evacuate all that could be of use to us, allowing our soldiers to confiscate a handful of convoys stationed in the city's harbour, with a number of Armenian civilians even volunteering to join our fight against the Ottoman Turks. More important than the spoils of war, however, is that Batumi finally gives our nation access to the seas beyond our mountainous home.\n\nBecause of this, and because the Georgians have thus far refused to join the war and are thus not in a position to enforce their claim on the city, some have suggested we should lay claim to Batumi ourselves. Although we could naturally veil our true motives for this under the guise of wanting to protect the local Armenian population from the Turkish brutes, and although control over the city would bring our nation great benefits, claiming it would surely anger the Georgians - and might even tempt them to strike at our nation should our ownership of the city become official. Furthermore, our current rule over Batumi is still shaky at best, and the Ottomans will without a doubt soon launch a counter-offensive, especially considering that we have not yet found the time to properly entrench our positions.

This comedy was written by Derenik Demirchyan and Amasi Martirosyan, and is based on the popular folk tale that goes by the same name. Because the story is loved and known throughout the country, our people have been awaiting the movie for a while now and were more than eager to watch it on the day of its release.\n\nThe movie tells the story of Nazar, a lazy and cowardly man who has more luck than judgement. One day, he jokes about robbing the caravan of a Shah passing nearby, but his wife takes him seriously and demands that he stays true to his word. Although he wants to chicken out of it at first, he later gets annoyed by some flies and manages to kill a thousand of them with a single swat. This gives him courage, and the village priest thereafter gifts him a rag on which he wrote 'Nazar the Brave, who fear does not know, kills a thousand with a single blow!'. Confident in his abilities, Nazar then sets out to find the Shah, and through sheer luck manages to outsmart a bandit, whose horse he then takes with him. Then follows coincidence after coincidence, eventually leading to Nazar's name being known and feared throughout the world - and not just that, he also kills a dangerous tiger, becomes king of a realm of giants, marries a giantess, and lives happily ever after.\n\nThe movie was well-received, and people are calling it both hilarious and exciting. Overall, it appears to be a good distraction from the shocking news coming from other parts of the world, and could very well become a classic that our people will still watch decades from now."

Whilst he had only mild success in achieving this goal, the time he spent in these countries, or rather in their restaurants, inspired him to bring new western-style food to our nation, namely corn flakes, popcorn, hamburgers, and ice cream, the latter being especially important to him.\n\nTo ensure our citizens always have access to the best ice cream, the government has, at the recommendation of Mikoyan, sponsored the construction of the first Armenian ice cream factory, which is to be built in our capital city of Yerevan. Mikoyan also plans to keep the quality of our domestically produced ice cream under his own personal control, arguing that he knows best what makes it delicious. Furthermore, he invented a new kind of hamburger beef patty, the so-called 'Mikoyan Cutlet'. He promised that this cutlet, which is made from beef or pork, would keep the burgers affordable for the common folk and make Armenian hamburgers something unique and outstanding, maybe even something known throughout the world.\n\nAlthough some are beginning to joke about Mikoyan's obsession with food and especially ice cream, a large part of the population welcomes these changes to the Armenian diet. For them, they are something exciting and out of the ordinary, and also give a feeling of a more westernised and modern lifestyle. This reaction of the populace has strengthened his belief in the importance of the right nourishment and has now even encouraged him to write a book on the topic of healthy and tasty food."

Especially concepts such as freedom of speech and freedom of thought are being disregarded and have been declared 'poisonous to the integrity of the state'. From now on, all newspapers will be controlled and strictly censored by the Tseghakronutyun. Publishing critical literature or spreading pamphlets criticising the government has now officially been declared a crime and will be punished severely. In order to ensure that the people understand that this should not be taken lightly, the party also ordered the expansion of most Armenian detention facilities, hoping that increasing their capacities will scare the Armenian people away from critical thought and bring even the most die-hard defenders of democratic values into the fold."

With this act, he wants to rid the nation of these 'Takanks' in order to bring our people stability and unity. It states that 'every Azeri and Turk is to leave the territory of the Armenian state within the span of three weeks. Should they refuse to leave within the given time span, the military will be authorised to expel them from their homes. Should they not comply, usage of force is permitted.'\n\nNaturally, this has sparked outrage among the Muslim population of the country, since Turks and Azeris alike now see themselves being prosecuted in the lands both they and their ancestors once called their home. However, the act did not only shock the Muslim parts of our population. Many Armenians are beginning to ask themselves if Nzhdeh really does what is right and if the expulsion of people they value as neighbours, friends and colleagues really is a necessary step to safeguard the future of the Armenian nation. Many still hope that Nzhdeh heeds the calls of the populace and decides to revoke the act before it unfolds its consequences, though a decision like this seems highly unlikely, especially since most of the military still blindly follows his orders and supports him and his measures without questions."

Agitated by one of Nzhdeh's speeches, in which he emphasised the need for an omnipotent state, some of his devoted followers saw themselves as invested by a mission to do something about the ever-denounced 'enemies within'. In their eyes, those still seeking to undermine the influence of the Tseghakronutyun could be found in prisons, where former Ottoman administrators are still held, and in the streets, where a demonstration by Muslim citizens was organised against the Expulsion Act.\n\nArmed with improvised weapons and a few firearms, the fanatics stormed the capital's prisons and fell upon the peaceful protest. What followed was nothing short of a slaughter. As the demonstrators fled throughout the streets, many were pursued and felled: bystanders who tried to shield them from the violence, sheltering them in their homes, or simply attempting to stand between them and the mob, can be counted among the casualties. In the prisons however, it seems that the guards simply stood aside, some even joining in, as resent against the Turks runs high. As for Yerevan's garrison troops, they remained idle: many of them are receptive to Nzhdeh's rhetoric and believe that protecting Muslim or prisoner lives is not part of their duty. When night fell, dozens laid dead, and many more were injured.\n\nNews of the massacre spread throughout the country like wildfire. In an emergency broadcast addressing the tragic situation, Nzhdeh attempted to shift the blame on the victims, described as conspirators, only blaming those he suggested were merely animated by 'patriotic fervour' for taking justice in their own hands. This narrative seldom convinced those who are not entirely in the grasps of the regime, however: for many, this was the last straw. Faith in Nzhdeh among our people is beginning to crumble, and resistance to the government is organising rapidly."

Today, these parties issued a joint statement, in which they declared Nzhdeh responsible for the recent bloodbath and openly demanded his resignation and the introduction of free elections on Armenian soil. Furthermore, some of them also took to the streets of the capital, and organised a memorial march to honour the victims of the massacre. However, this march became increasingly political as the number of participants increased, and ended up as an open protest against Nzhdeh's regime.\n\nSensing a threat to their rule, the Tseghakronutyun responded swiftly by ordering the military to break up the 'violent demonstration against the saviours of Armenia'. Still, Nzhdeh felt that this was not enough. He decided to go even further, and has officially decreed the dissolution of all political parties and organisations not integrated into the Tseghakronist movement. By stripping away their last political powers, he hopes to silence the remaining politicians of the opposition once and for all."

In their exodus out of the capital and other major cities, they were joined by some lower-ranking military officers, the most prominent of them being Boghos Bey Dadian, a former Ottoman colonel who pledged allegiance to Armenia and her people during the Desert War and has grown increasingly uncontent with Nzhdeh and his rather extreme policies. Once they no longer found themselves in any immediate danger, they began forging plans, hoping to topple the Tseghakronist government that has 'destroyed' their once so lovely country. During this time, Boghos Bey more or less officially assumed leadership of the opposition group, mostly because both the democrats and the common folk put their trust in him and his experience as an officer, confident that he could lead them to victory against the Tseghakronist regime.\n\nAfter spending some weeks gathering support and perfecting their plans, the democrats have now decided to come out of hiding and to march on to the capital. Before the news of their return could spread throughout the country, they arrived in Yerevan, where many joined their ranks before the Tseghakronutyun had time to react. In no time, they had a substantial force, consisting mainly of the common folk of our capital, on their side. As they begin their march towards the centre of the pink city, Nzhdeh is trying to organise a defence and has ordered the military to shoot anyone trying to threaten his 'righteous rule'. Since the democrats and their followers are mostly armed with improvised weapons, save for the few soldiers and officers supporting them, the army could probably prevent their coup attempt with ease. However, a large part of the city's defenders are beginning to question their own motives and are asking themselves whether they are still standing on the right side, and if the democrats really are the evil Nzhdeh makes them out to be. Today, the allegiance of these men will decide the fate of our nation."

Nzhdeh's order to open fire on their fellow countrymen was the last straw. Instead of heeding his commands, the garrison units turned on him and joined the protesters in their march towards the centre of Yerevan. The last soldiers loyal to the Tseghakronist cause soon found themselves outnumbered and outgunned, and were forced to lay down their arms.\n\nAs the democrats, now with the support of both the military and the civilian population of the capital, drew ever closer to the National Assembly, the Tseghakron politicians present there acknowledged the hopelessness of their situation and surrendered without putting up much of a fight. Whilst they were deemed 'traitors to the state' and placed under house arrest until trials could be organised, Nzhdeh was nowhere to be found. It is speculated that he has somehow managed to escape the capital, presumably with the aid of the last few staunch supporters of his cause, and is now trying to find refuge in exile.\n\nStill, Nzhdeh's whereabouts are not of great concern to Bey and his supporters as of now, as they have achieved their goal: they have toppled the Tseghakronist government and can now pursue a different political course, one that isn't nearly as extreme as that of the Tseghakronutyun. With the backing of the people, the military, and the democratic politicians, Boghos Bey Dadian, leader of the coup, has taken leadership of the nation and now plans to fulfil the promises Nzhdeh made to the people and to bring both peace and prosperity to Armenia."

Heeding Nzhdeh's commands, the soldiers stopped the protesters advancing towards the centre of the capital, albeit they still refused to open fire on the civilians that joined up with the democrats. However, Boghos Bey and the soldiers accompanying him were deemed traitors to the state, a danger to the stability of the Armenian nation, and overall too dangerous to be left alive. Without any need for further orders from Nzhdeh, his loyalists fell upon these 'traitors' - and at the end of the day, Boghos Bey, a once famed and respected officer of our armed forces, laid dead in the streets of the city, killed by the men he thought would assist him in his endeavour to end Nzhdeh's rule once and for all.\n\nAs the fighting between Yerevan's garrison and Bey and his soldiers started, the crowd that promised the democrats their support quickly dispersed, fearing that they might otherwise be caught up in the crossfire. The democratic politicians that organised the coup attempt laid down their arms shortly after their leader was killed, and have by now been put in prison for their crimes against the government. With the leaders of the former opposition now being forced to spend their remaining days in dark cells, isolated from the rest of the country, the last major resistance movement against the Tseghakronist government has been crushed. Now all that is left is a general feeling of discontent among the populace, but this will likely fade away if Nzhdeh manages to fulfil his promises and to restore Armenia to its former glory."

This way, Nzhdeh hopes that he can guide both the younger and older generations in the right direction and turn them into loyal subjects to his cause.\n\nThese seven cults are: 1.The Cult of the Motherland, emphasising the importance of the land on which the Armenian culture first came into being, and promoting devotion and worship of said land. 2.The Cult of Blood, highlighting the spiritual and bodily traits that define the Armenian people, and set them apart from other cultures. 3.The Cult of Language, which forbids our people from learning or speaking any language other than their mother tongue, since this would accelerate the death of the beautiful Armenian language. 4.The Cult of the Fallen, which says that one should not forget those who gave their life in the name of Armenia and her people. Because of our recent independence war, which saw countless Armenian men dying on the fields of honour, this cult is especially important to Nzhdeh. 5.The Cult of our Ancestors. This cult declares that there is a spiritual connection between the different generations of our people, and that this connection ensures that the eternal flame of the nation and thus our sacred traditions will be passed from one generation to another. 6.The Cult of Power, which says that only those who are strong and brave will survive this cruel world. 7.The Cult of our Leader, Nzhdeh.

Incentivised by the Tehcir Law, the Temporary Law of Deportation, the following years saw much of the historical Armenian territory outside of the mountains of Yerevan almost entirely 'cleansed' of its original inhabitants, as many of those who were not 'resettled' by the Ottomans decided that fleeing the Empire was their best bet. Naturally, most of our population has not forgotten this terror.\n\nEarlier this year, as the 25th anniversary of the 'Red Sunday' was drawing ever closer, a group of intellectuals felt that it was about time to properly honour the victims of the massacres, and came to the government with a proposal: the construction of a memorial site on the hill of Tsitsernakaberd in the centre of Yerevan. According to their proposition, this memorial should both \"be dedicated to the Armenian martyrs of the Weltkrieg\" and \"symbolise the renaissance of the Armenian people\", and thus not only serve as a way to remember the past, but also show that a better future is coming.\n\nDespite the broadness of the proposal, our government was quick to accept it and to provide the necessary funds, as the Armenian Massacres are a rather important subject for our common folk and our politicians alike. With the support of some engineers, a more exact plan was drafted, and as of now, it was decided that the monument should consist of two parts: a large stele, symbolising the rebirth of our people and the future they have ahead of them, and a circle made up of several slabs, representing the provinces of western Armenia lost to the Turks.

Because of its age, it has also been renovated multiple times throughout the years, and thus nowadays combines architectural styles from various different ages, giving the cathedral not only religious, historical, and cultural, but also architectural significance.\n\nDespite all this, however, Etchmiadzin was not spared by the war, and was hit by artillery shells and bombs on multiple occasions throughout the conflict, forcing the Catholicos to relocate to Yerevan for the time being. Seeing the turrets of the cathedral begin to crumble has understandably been a hard blow, not just to the clergy and the citizens of Vagharshapat, but to the entire country and to the Armenian diaspora abroad as well. This tragedy has not gone unnoticed by our politicians, and with our government already undertaking major endeavours to rebuild the country, it has been decided that the restoration of the cathedral, too, should be state-funded. This news has been well received, especially by the church, and many are now looking forward to seeing Etchmiadzin shine in new glamour, even if it might take some time for the restoration to complete."

 arm.60.t: "A Lonely Hike"
 arm.60.d: "During an exercise in the western mountain ranges of our country, a group of soldiers noticed a lone man in a ragged military uniform slowly making his way towards the peak of a nearby mountain without acknowledging the military unit observing him from afar. Intrigued by the sight and eager to find out why he was wearing the clothing of an Armenian infantryman, our soldiers decided to approach the stranger. As they gradually caught up to him, he elected to ignore them no longer, and instead stopped his hike, sat on the ground, and waited. After a few minutes, they finally reached the man, and after a short breather, they asked him for his story and what he was doing all alone out in the mountains. He sat still for a second, but then he began to explain himself.\n\nA volunteer for the army during the War of Independence, the man was stationed on our southern border with the Turks. One night, during which he was supposed to guard the encampment of his unit, he simply dozed off, and, as fate would have it, the Turks launched a surprise attack on his position only a few hours later. Woken up by gunshots and screams, his fear got the best of him, and he ran from the ongoing battle, leaving his comrades to be routed by the enemy.\n\nThough thinking of his own survival as nothing less than a miracle, the man has not forgiven himself, and his cowardice haunts him to this day. Unwilling and unable to return to the military, he instead decided to find his peace in the quiet of the Armenian mountains, and is now wandering from peak to peak and travelling through the land, hoping to find insight and forgiveness in his self-imposed solitude."
 arm.60.a: "Let us hope he finds his peace."
 arm.60.b: "His cowardice needs to be punished! He shall stand trial!"
 arm.61.t: "The Excavation of Teishebaini"
 arm.61.d: "Following a trail of various different artefacts and inscriptions that have been found in recent years, a group of archaeologists has managed to uncover what is probably one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in the entire Middle East - the ancient fortress of Teishebaini. Located on Kamir Blur, the 'Red Mould', the ruins lie not far from our capital city of Yerevan. Thus far, only parts of the central citadel, a few smaller buildings, and a cemetery have been uncovered, but our archaeologists are certain that much more lies buried beneath the earth, just waiting to be dug up, and some information regarding the fate and history of the town has already been unveiled.\n\nTwo different cuneiform inscriptions mentioning Rusa Argishtihini, also known as Rusa II, king of the ancient realm of Urartu, have been found and have led to the assumption that the fortress was constructed during his reign, which would in turn mean that the site dates back more than two and a half millennia, to the seventh century BC. Spanning from eastern Anatolia and north-western Persia all the way to the Armenian mountains, the kingdom of Urartu is believed to be one of the earliest predecessors to the first Kingdom of Armenia, and Scythian arrowheads that have been found within the ruins of Teishebaini have reinforced the theory that the decline and eventual fall of the kingdom was caused by a devastating war against the Scythians. As for the fortress itself, it can currently only be speculated how exactly it was destroyed, but several charred items hint at a fire razing it to the ground."
 arm.61.a: "Who knows what more there is to uncover."
 arm.62.t: "A New National Anthem?"
 arm.62.d: "With our independence being secured for the moment and the political situation slowly stabilising, our government can now turn its attention to some less pressing issues. One of those is that our country is still lacking an official national anthem, something that every modern nation should have. Though our politicians agree on the criteria of a good anthem, that it should be easily recognisable and represent our people and their values, there have thus far been several proposals on which song fulfils these criteria best, and no clear winner has been determined yet.\n\nThe obvious and probably also the most popular choice would be 'Mer Hayrenik' or 'Our Fatherland', a song which was already adopted as the national anthem of the first Armenian Republic after the Weltkrieg. Its text is based on an Italian poem and was written by Mikayel Nalbandian in the 19th century, with the music being arranged by Parsegh Ganatchian a few decades later. Highlighting the glory of our fatherland and our flag, and the honour our soldiers find in death, it is a very patriotic song and perfectly reflects the struggles our people have had to endure over the course of the last few decades.\n\nSome politicians are, however, arguing that we are an entirely new state, one that will succeed where the first Republic has failed. Subsequently, they are of the opinion that our anthem should reflect that, and that an entirely new song should be composed to represent our nation. Not wanting to stray too far from 'Mer Hayrenik', though, they still want to address the same topics whilst slightly shifting the focus from our past to our future and also covering the 'rebirth' our nation has recently experienced."
 arm.62.a: "Mer Hayrenik it is!"
 arm.62.b: "Change is needed, we shall compose a new anthem!"
 arm.62.c: "Let's compose one honouring Nzhdeh instead!"
 arm.63.t: "[ARM.GetNameDefCap]请求庇护"
 arm.63.d: "After the nation of Armenia declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Desert War, it found itself in a rather vulnerable and isolated state. Surrounded by the Persians, the Turks, and ourselves, the Armenians feared that they would be hopelessly outnumbered should one of their neighbours ever decide to invade their homeland. Hence, the Armenian government has been searching for a country to guarantee its independence, and has now come to us, bargaining for protection.\n\nThis request has led to some of the more expansionist voices within our government sensing an opportunity. They say that if we promise to treat the Armenian people well, [ARM.GetLeader] could probably be convinced of the idea of Armenia returning to Russian overlordship. Although he probably isn't too keen on surrendering Armenia's independence without a fight, he knows that we are more trustworthy than both the Turks and the Persians and would be wise to pick the lesser evil for his people, or else he might see them under the Turkish yoke again.\n\nHowever, others have argued that a de facto annexation of Armenia would be disadvantegous for our nation, and that it would be a better idea to force Armenia to become economically dependant on us. Surely, they wouldn't say no to some economic concessions and a few trade deals between our two nations favourable for the Russian side if this means securing the independence and sovereignty of [ARM.GetNameDef]."

 arm.64.d: "In response to our appeal for protection, [RUS.GetNameDef] suggested that we could save the lives of our people by returning Armenia to 'its rightful Russian overlords', and by giving up our dream of an independent and sovereign state. Although this is certainly not what we have hoped for, the Russians did promise to treat our people well and to respect their culture and customs, and are certainly the lesser evil when comparing them to our other, more bloodthirsty neighbours. Of course we could also try to survive on our own, but this might lead to the pointless death of thousands, and could potentially result in the utter annihilation of our beloved country. With us now being forced to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea, we should calculate our next move carefully, as it could very well seal the fate of our nation."

Now, they find themselves alone and unprotected, and no one is stopping us, the Persians or the Turks from subjugating their pitiful nation by force. All that remains to be seen is if [ARM.GetLeader] and his supporters will live long enough to understand the gravity of their mistakes."
 arm.65.a: "他们等会儿就该后悔了。"
 arm.66.t: "亚美尼亚接受我们的提议"
 arm.66.d: "The wise men of Armenia appear to have understood that returning to Russian overlordship is the only way to save their skin, and have agreed to our offer of 'protection through annexation'. With us now once again controlling Armenia, our influence in the Caucasus has grown substantially, and another province formerly held by the Russian Empire has found its way back into our hands."

 arm.67.d: "[RUS.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to offer us their protection, has however also demanded economic concessions as a form of compensation. Although accepting the Russian demands would make our economy greatly dependant on Russia and also weaken our government's control over our national industry, these concessions overall aren't too bad, especially when comparing them to what would happen to our nation without Russian backing. Hopefully, our new benefactor will make our neighbours think twice before setting a foot on our land."

From now on, we shall be Armenia's greatest trading partner, and a certain share of their domestic production shall go to us.

Seeing as they are currently in a rather vulnerable state and thus reliant on foreign support, we could very well try to strike some favourable deals out of this situation.\n\nWithin our government, two different proposals on how to respond to this request have been put forward. Some of our more ambitious politicians think that we should abuse this situation to the fullest, and advocate pressuring Armenia into becoming our puppet state in return for our protection. However, it is uncertain if the Armenians would accept this request, since it would effectively put an end to the independence they are trying to preserve. The safer option would probably be to demand the right to supervise their military. This approach would still increase our influence over Armenia significantly, whilst also guaranteeing that they could never take up arms against us. Furthermore, since this wouldn't put an end to Armenian sovereignty, it isn't as likely to be turned down by the Armenian government."

Seeking to expand their sphere of influence in the Caucasus, they've demanded control of our foreign affairs in return for guaranteeing to protect our independence. Naturally, our government did not receive this news very well, since complying with these terms would reduce Armenia to a Persian puppet state, leading to us losing most of the liberties we fought so vigorously for. Still, Persian protection could deter our other neighbours from attacking our beloved country, and could thus save thousands of Armenian lives. We'll have to decide what we value more - our national sovereignty, or the lives of our people."

 arm.73.d: "The Persian response to our request has finally reached Yerevan! In return for protecting our country, the Persian government has demanded what it calls 'military cooperation' between our two countries. This cooperation, however, would greatly favour the Persians, and allow them to supervise our army by replacing some of our military staff with Persian officers. Whilst this would make it more or less impossible to plan military operations against [PER.GetNameDef], as they would immediately get wind of our plans, our soldiers could probably benefit from the experience these officers would bring to the table. Overall, this doesn't seem too harsh of a demand, and has been received pretty well by our government."

 arm.75.d: "Today, a rather interesting request reached the office of [TUR.GetLeader]. The Armenian government, fearful of [PER.GetAdjective] and Russian aggression, appealed to our nation for protection. Considering the history we have with the Armenians, they must truly be desperate coming to us for help. However, we shouldn't turn them down just because of the differences we had in the past. Agreeing to protect Armenia would be an important step in containing the expansion of those challenging our hegemony over the region, and making new friends in the Caucasus could also benefit us in the long run. Still, this move could draw us into a deadly and destructive war over land that isn't even a part of our nation - a risk we definitely should not take lightly."

We can only hope that this will be enough to keep our other neighbours away from our lands."
 arm.77.a: "共赴胜利！"
 arm.78.t: "对土耳其庇护的抗议"
 arm.78.d: "Although the decision of our government to appeal for Turkish protection undoubtedly had many political benefits, it was by no means a popular one. Apparently, the rebuilding of diplomatic relations between our two countries is a step too far in the eyes of a large part of our population, for they feel that the Turks cannot be trusted. This has many reasons, which can mainly be found in the history the Turkish and the Armenian people share with each other. For centuries, the Armenian people were forced to live under Turkish rule, with every notion of resistance and nationalism being suppressed brutally. This culminated in the massacres of the Weltkrieg, which some of our people still remember vividly. For them, all Turks are to blame for these tragedies, even if the government to our west is no longer the one that suppressed our people for generations.\n\nToday, thousands took to the streets to officially protest against the already signed protection treaty, which for them is nothing but an outright betrayal of all the Armenian nation stands for. Luckily, the protests stayed peaceful thus far, and although their numbers are still growing larger by the hour, it doesn't seem like the protesters are about to turn to violence. Still, the trust our people put in our government has taken a big hit, and it will take some time before they realise the necessity of the protection treaty."

Whilst this has been the case for centuries now and our people have already been establishing settlements in regions such as Cilcia, Italy and Cyprus during the Middle Ages, an increasing number of them has left the region of Greater Armenia as a result of the crimes committed against them by the Ottoman Turks. Especially the massacres of the Weltkrieg convinced many Armenians that staying in their homeland was a risk not worth taking, leading to them leaving their country and seeking their fortune elsewhere, far away from their Turkish oppressors.\n\nEver since our nation reentered the world stage, there has been a steady influx of Armenian immigrants from all around the world seeking to repopulate their homeland, which they formerly believed to be forever lost to the Turks. However, many hesitated to return to the land of their ancestors, mainly because of the ongoing conflict and the feeling that Armenia's independence was immensely threatened by its power-hungry and ambitious neighbours. Now though, with us having won the war of independence and our sovereignty being somewhat secured, these doubts have cleared up, and the number of immigrants has skyrocketed. Although these immigrants thus far mainly come from the Middle Eastern nations, and most of our fellow countrymen currently living in Europe and the Americas have decided not to abandon their lives there, it's still a good sight to see that our people are slowly beginning to return to their home."

In order to improve the research capabilities of our nation, they deem it necessary to not only expand the existing institutions, but also to sponsor new ones. More concretely, they plan on founding the National Academy of Sciences. This new academy, which would be located in our capital city of Yerevan, would mainly focus its research on both science and social sciences, and would thus greatly complement the already existing University of Yerevan, which focuses mostly on the fields of history, economics and culture.\n\nWhilst the majority of our government seems to be in favour of accepting this proposal, seeing as it would probably be a rather efficient way to fund talented Armenian scientists, not everyone has been convinced, and there are also some questioning whether or not this is a rational allocation of our resources."

This joyous occasion mainly consisted of a speech given by the academy's first president, Joseph Orbeli. In it, he emphasised his gratitude for the funds he and his fellow scientists received from the government, and spoke about his visions for the future. He dreams of the academy becoming a centre of attention for scientists from all around the globe, of major breakthroughs in the various fields focused on by the academy, and of Armenian science being on par with that of the Western countries. This rather ambitious speech was met with the thunderous applause of all those attending the ceremony, including the press, the academics who are going to conduct their research in the new facilities, and even some government representatives.\n\nAlready, some scientists have begun the preparations for their first experiments in the new facility; Joseph Obeli and a few government officials have started negotiations about new funds which could be used to expand the academy even further; and news of the inauguration ceremony has spread throughout the country. The overall reaction of the populace seems to be quite positive, and a general feeling of enthusiasm is spreading, for the people are hoping that this is the beginning of something truly great."

Ever since, the so-called 'Council of Armenian Orthography' has been working tirelessly, trying to find out how to make the Armenian language more phonetic and less complex. The goal of this endeavour is to create a language that is both easy to learn and to read. With this, the Council hopes to make the Armenian language more attractive to foreigners and to help solve Armenia's illiteracy problem.\n\nToday, the leaders of the Council presented our government with their proposed reform and requested for it to be both accepted and implemented throughout the country. Although it appears that they've tried to take a less radical approach at reforming the Armenian language, it is nevertheless to be expected that some of our people will be rather unhappy with the reform, seeing as it would replace the classical orthography, which many consider to be an important part of our culture. It is now up to us to decide what we value more: the opinion of some of our most educated citizens, or our time-honoured traditions."

There, government officials from Armenia presented our representatives with a proposal: cooperation in the form of an alliance between our two states, which should at least last until the Ottoman beast has been slain.\n\nThough this may sound like a good opportunity to better our relations with our new neighbour on paper, it is rather questionable how much Armenia could contribute to the alliance, and it could turn out to be a burden that would only pull us down.

Then, voices started growing louder, and our border guard naturally went on high alert, fearing the Turks might be conducting a surprise attack. However, just as our men were about to contact high command in order to receive new orders and to ask for reinforcements, the voices became audible enough to be understood. Unexpectedly, the approaching men spoke Armenian, and were now shouting at the border guards not to open fire on them. Since our soldiers remained sceptical, the strangers then laid down their arms as a show of good will, and one of them, with his hands high up in the air, slowly approached the border.\n\nAfter being searched thoroughly to check whether he posed a threat, he proceeded to explain what was currently happening. Apparently, he himself is none other than Boghos Bey Dadian, a famous Ottoman colonel of Armenian descent. He and the formerly Ottoman soldiers following his lead, who are also Armenians, deserted shortly after our rebellion began, unwilling to fight for an Empire actively suppressing their very own countrymen. Together, they organised a plan to cross the border and to take as much military equipment as they possibly could with them - and now they were here.\n\nUpon hearing this story and after ensuring that what they were told was true, the border guard let the men enter our country, and by now most of them have already enlisted in our armed forces, ready to partake in the fight for the liberty of Armenia and her people. As for Boghos Bey, he has found his way to the capital, where he has been promoted to the rank of general by the high command, so that the experience he has gathered in years of service under the Ottoman flag may be put to good use."

This comes as a great victory to our people, as the region has strong historic ties to the Armenian nation. A millennium ago, under the reign of the Bagratuni dynasty, the city of Kars served as the capital of the Kingdom of Armenia, and although Kars was conquered by several outside powers since its foundation, including the Seljuk and Ottoman Turks, the region continued to be inhabited predominantly by Armenians - until the Weltkrieg turned the tides of history.\n\nServing as one of the main battlefields between the Russian and Ottoman forces during the conflict, the region was harmed greatly by the war, and its population was not spared from the horrors Ottoman troops inflicted upon those of Armenian descent. Fearing for their lives, many chose to migrate eastwards, making those that stayed behind a minority in their own home.\n\nNow, however, with us having liberated Kars, it seems that a new age of Armenian rule over the region is upon us. Following our advance, an increasing number of locals has revealed that they, in fact, identify as ethnic Armenians, but have been hiding their true identity out of fear of being persecuted by the Turks, with some even taking up arms and joining our army in the fight against their former oppressors. These fresh recruits, in addition to a number of arms plundered from the local arsenal, will aid our war effort considerably, and with Ottoman troops thus far unable to halt our advance, the dream of an independent Armenian state is slowly becoming reality."

By now, however, it seems that their long wait will not be rewarded, as, with every passing day, it becomes increasingly unlikely for Nzhdeh to return or for him to reveal that he has found refuge in exile. With more than a month having passed since the march on the capital, it is only natural that rumours about Nzhdeh's whereabouts are beginning to spread rapidly, the most believable of which being that he met his fate on his flight towards, presumably, Russia, be that at the hands of nature or of the men that had suffered under his rule.\n\nTrue or not, without the figure of Nzhdeh to rally behind, and with the atrocities they advocated and their failure to prevent Bey's coup, the Tseghakronutyun have by now largely lost popular support. Most Tseghakronist hardliners have been imprisoned by government forces or have chosen the path of exile, with Hayk Asatryan, one of Nzhdeh's closest associates and one of the leading ideologues of the Tseghakronutyun, now hoping to carry on the work of his paragon from beyond the seas and to foster the movement in the diaspora.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armenian National Liberation Movement had long been split between the autocrats under Nzhdeh's guidance and the democrats who opposed his radical views. With much of the military, however, having chosen to align themselves with Boghos Bey and thus the democrats, most militarymen once loyal to Nzhdeh have likewise used their chance to stand on the victorious side of the power struggle, and have promised the new government their continued support and loyalty. With Nzhdeh and his extremist forces thus having largely lost their footing in our country, it seems that the position of the new regime has been secured, and that the era of terror heralded by the Tseghakronists has become nothing but a relic of the past."

Furthermore, an Armenian victory over the Ottoman Turks would not only decisively weaken one of our greatest foes, but would also greatly increase our influence over the Caucasus Mountains, maybe even paving the way for an alliance between Yerevan and [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nOn the other hand, refusing to support the Armenian rebellion would mean leaving our brethren to their fate. Nonetheless, there have also been voices in our government that deem the requested gun shipments a 'waste of resources', arguing that Armenia's chance of success is rather questionable as it stands and that we cannot afford to pointlessly sacrifice our military equipment at the moment, especially when taking our western border into account."

 arm.91.d: "Our brethren in [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have elected to heed our plea for support and have promised to send military equipment to assist us in our struggle against the Turkish oppressors. These gun shipments, which are already well on their way to our capital, will allow us to arm additional volunteers for the fight against the tyrants of [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] - and, given the quality of Russian manufacturing when compared to the rather dated equipment of the Ottoman army, will likely guarantee that our soldiers keep the upper hand on the fields of battle."
 arm.91.a: "We welcome their support."
 arm.92.t: "Russia Refuses to Send Equipment"
 arm.92.d: "Citing that their military equipment is currently much needed elsewhere, the Russians have turned down our request for support in our war against the Ottoman Turks. It appears that the politicians of [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] care neither about the brave Armenian men giving their lives on the frontlines of this conflict, nor about the hardships our people will have to endure should the Turkish tyrants once again manage to subdue our nation."
 arm.92.a: "This is an outrage!"
 arm.100.t: "[ARM.GetNameDefCap]请求德国斡旋"
 arm.100.d: "The nation of [ARM.GetNameDef] has approached our government with a request that we mediate a conference they are planning. Wishing to bury the hatchet with the Turkish people of [TUR.GetNameDef], the Armenians have called together a conference.\n\nOur presence at the conference would likely bring us both international prestige as the arbiter of peace, as well as additional allies in the region. Should we agree to mediate their conference?"
 arm.100.a: "调解，都可以调解。"
 arm.100.b: "自己的事自己做。"
 arm.101.t: "向[TUR.GetNameDef]索取赔偿"
 arm.101.d: "Without the backing power of a major power like [GER.GetNameDef], our position is more tenuous compared to the far larger [TUR.GetNameDef]. Should we maintain an aggressive stance with our demands from [TUR.GetNameDef], or be more restrained? Shall we force the Turks to pay out monetary compensation for the families uprooted by the massacres of 1915 and beyond?"
 arm.101.a: "胆大方能伸张正义！"
 arm.101.b: "具体数额上可以稍微克制下。"
 arm.102.t: "向[TUR.GetNameDef]索取赔偿"
 arm.102.d: "Great news! [GER.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to be there at the talks and mediate the conference for us. We can count on their assistance to pressure [TUR.GetNameDef] to be more agreeable. As such, what demands should we press them for? Shall we force the Turks to pay out monetary compensation for the families uprooted by the massacres of 1915 and beyond?"
 arm.102.a: "人们要的是彻底的正义！"
 arm.102.b: "还是提些稳妥的要求把。"

 german_agreement_with_armenia_conference: "The present delegation from [GER.GetNameDef] clearly seemed to be showing some partiality to the Armenian cause. While we are much stronger than the Armenians it may be unwise to draw the ire of Berlin."
 arm.103.t: "[ARM.GetNameDef]提出苛刻索赔案"
 arm.103.d: "At our meeting, the Armenians have put forward harsh demands from us. We must fully accept responsibility for the massacres and mass deportations carried out under the Ottoman Empire, primarily during the early years of the Weltkrieg. They are also asking for monetary compensation that they feel they are owed for the atrocities committed in the region by the Ottoman Empire against their people over the past half century."

 arm.104.t: "[ARM.GetNameDef]提出有限索赔案"
 arm.104.d: "At our meeting, the Armenians have put forward fairly reasonable demands from us. They are asking for a degree of monetary compensation for the atrocities committed in the region by the Ottoman Empire against their people over the past half century."

 arm.105.d: "A great victory has been won for the Armenian people! [TUR.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to compensate us monetarily for their actions in the early years of the Weltkrieg. Already, plans are being drawn up to build memorials dedicated to the lost towns of Armenia."
 arm.105.a: "对人们来说，算是个小小的安慰。"
 arm.106.d: "This conference has brought a great diplomatic victory to [ARM.GetNameDef]. [TUR.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to acknowledge responsibility and compensate [ARM.GetNameDef] for the actions undertaken by the Ottoman Empire during the early years of the Weltkrieg."
 arm.106.a: "Some measure of justice has been served."
 arm.107.t: "[ARM.GetNameDef]索赔遭[TUR.GetNameDefCap]拒绝"
 arm.107.d: "We have been scorned at the peace table. We came forward with a just request, yet still were rebuffed by the Turks who refuse to admit responsibility for the massacres that happened to the Armenian people. Additionally, they have rejected our request for monetary recompensation, as hollow as that demand was for those affected, it was still too much for [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to bow to."
 arm.107.a: "对亚美尼亚来说，不过又是黑暗的一天罢了。"
 arm.108.d: "Justice has been withheld from the Armenian people. [TUR.GetNameDefCap] has refused to accept their role in the massacres in Armenia and beyond. Additionally they have denied the Armenians any compensation as the first step in reconciliation. With this stain on the conference, there is uncertainty as to whether it will last."
 arm.109.t: "正式承认[ARM.GetNameDefCap]主权？"
 arm.109.d: "Moving on from the topic of compensation, the Armenian delegation has pushed for formal recognition of [ARM.GetNameDef] as a nation from [TUR.GetNameDef]. Such a move would strengthen the legitimacy of their state, as well as make progress on the mending of the strained relations between our people."
 arm.109.a: "承认[ARM.GetNameDef]。"
 arm.109.b: "拒绝承认[ARM.GetNameDef]。"
 arm.110.t: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap]承认[ARM.GetNameDefCap]主权"
 arm.110.d: "The delegation from [TUR.GetNameDef] agrees to recognise Armenia as a formal nation. With this admission, our ability to partake in more global diplomacy has been expanded. Our legitimacy is strengthened and reapproachment between our peoples has now taken its first step."
 arm.110.a: "新时代来临了！"
 arm.111.d: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to formally recognise Armenia as a nation. This opens up further diplomatic channels between us and the region. It seems that the first steps towards the reconciliation of the two peoples has begun."
 arm.111.a: "愿和平条约长存！"
 arm.112.t: "[TUR.GetNameDefCap]拒绝承认[ARM.GetNameDefCap]主权"
 arm.112.d: "Unwilling to recognise our equal status as a fellow nation, we have been scorned at the conference. Without Turkish acknowledgment of our state, we may struggle to find further recognition abroad."
 arm.112.a: "悲剧一场！"
 arm.113.d: "Unwilling to recognise [ARM.GetNameDef] as a fellow nation on the world sphere has come as a deathblow to the hopes of the Armenian people. Without Turkish support, the ability for [ARM.GetNameDef] to take part in the global stage is severely hampered."
 arm.113.a: "亚美尼亚的命运总免不了残酷。"
 arm.114.t: "执政联盟分裂！"
 arm.114.d: "Today, after another stormy session, the pointlessness of the further existence of the coalition of our parties, Dashnaks and Ramgavar, became apparent. Due to divergent positions on a series of issues, this leads us to take the obvious step of breaking the coalition pact between us and forming a single party government under [ARM.GetLeader]'s presidency as much as possible, until new elections are held in the country.\nAs a result of the collapse of the coalition, some members of both parties decided to try their luck and formed their own party, which claims to be the successor of the well-known Armenakan party, which hasn't been active since 1921. A famous writer and member of the Armenian General Benevolent Union Levon Pashalian, which helped our compatriots abroad, headed the new party.\nSimilarly, the Armenian Populist Party, founded in 1917 after the February Revolution and lead by its founder Michael Papadjanian, which supports a conservative-liberal programme, raised its head, sensing a chance to gain popularity."
 arm.114.a: "真是脆弱的联盟啊。"
